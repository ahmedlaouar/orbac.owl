The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;1127;623;"The decision to grant Bob_Smith permission to perform the ""sign"" activity on ""agreement3"" is based on the following logic:

**Decision Rule:** Access is granted if, for every prohibition supporting a denial of access, there is a corresponding permission support that ""dominates"" it. Dominance means that each element in the permission support is strictly preferred over *at least one* element in the prohibition support.

**Outcome Decision:** Grant Access

**Reasoning:**

Let's analyze the supports and preferences:

* **Permission Supports:**
    * **Support 1:**  Institute1 grants Bob_Smith (in the ""researcher"" role) permission to ""validate"" on ""data"" under the ""secondment"" context. This support involves:
        * Institute1 employing Bob_Smith as a researcher
        * Consortium considering ""sign"" as a valid ""validate"" activity
        * Agreement3 being used in the ""data"" view
        * ""Secondment"" context holding between Bob Smith, ""sign"", and Agreement3 in Institute1
    *  **Support 2:**  Institute2 grants Bob Smith (as a ""researcher"") permission to  ""validate"" on  ""secondment_agreement"" under ""secondment"". This support has similar elements to Support 1, but refers to Institute2 and a different view.

* **Prohibition Supports:**
   * **Support  1:** Institute2 prohibits Bob_Smith  (in the ""post_doc"" role) from ""validating"" on ""confidential_data"" under ""collaboration"". This involves:
       * Institute2 employing Bob Smith as a post_doc
       * Consortium considering  ""sign"" as ""validate""
       * Agreement3 in the ""confidential data"" view
       * ""Collaboration"" context holding.
    * *Support 2:* Institute2 prohibits  Bob_Smith (as ""secondee"") from  ""validating""  on ""public_data""  under the ""default"" context.

**Dominance Analysis:**

* **Comparison 1:** Support 1 (Permission) vs. Support 1(Prohibition): 
    * ""Researcher"" role is preferred to ""Post-doc"" role.
    *""Secondment""* context is preferred to *""Collaboration""* context.
    Therefore, Permission Support 1 dominates Prohibition Support 1.

*  **Comparison 2:** Support 2 (Permission)  vs.  Support 2 (Prohibition):
    * *""Researcher""* role is preferred  to *""Secondee""* role.
     * *""Secondment""*  context is preferred to  *""Default""* context.

    Therefore, both Permission Supports 1 and 2 dominate Prohibition Support 2.

**Conclusion:**

Since every prohibition is dominated by at least one permission, the access is granted to Bob_Smith.
