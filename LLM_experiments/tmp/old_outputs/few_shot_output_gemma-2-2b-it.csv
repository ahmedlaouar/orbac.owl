An access is granted if and only if,         for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.         Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization University3 grants the role wp_leader the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view WP4 if the context audit holds,The organisation University3 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role wp_leader, The organisation Consortium considers create as a modify activity, The organisation University3 uses dataset4 in the view WP4, The context audit holds between Wendy_Mitchell, create, and dataset4 in the organisation University3,  
(support 2): The organization University1 grants the role wp_leader the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view reports if the context audit holds,The organisation University1 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role wp_leader, The organisation Consortium considers create as a modify activity, The organisation University1 uses dataset4 in the view reports, The context audit holds between Wendy_Mitchell, create, and dataset4 in the organisation University1,  
3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
(support 1): The organization University1 grants the role secondee the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view public_data if the context collaboration holds,The organisation University1 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role secondee, The organisation Consortium considers create as a modify activity, The organisation University1 uses dataset4 in the view public_data, The context collaboration holds between Wendy_Mitchell, create, and dataset4 in the organisation University1,  
(support 2): The organization University1 grants the role associate_professor the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view public_data if the context collaboration holds,The organisation University1 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role associate_professor, The organisation Consortium considers create as a modify activity, The organisation University1 uses dataset4 in the view public_data, The context collaboration holds between Wendy_Mitchell, create, and dataset4 in the organisation University1,  
(support 3): The organization University2 grants the role associate_professor the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view WP4 if the context collaboration holds,The organisation University2 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role associate_professor, The organisation Consortium considers create as a modify activity, The organisation University2 uses dataset4 in the view WP4, The context collaboration holds between Wendy_Mitchell, create, and dataset4 in the organisation University2,  
4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation University3 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role wp_leader, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University1 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role secondee, `` because: wp_leader is preferred to secondee. 
The relation ``The context audit holds between Wendy_Mitchell, create, and dataset4 in the organisation University3, `` is preferred to ``The context collaboration holds between Wendy_Mitchell, create, and dataset4 in the organisation University1, `` because: audit is preferred to collaboration. 
The relation ``The organisation University3 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role wp_leader, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University1 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role associate_professor, `` because: wp_leader is preferred to associate_professor. 
The relation ``The context audit holds between Wendy_Mitchell, create, and dataset4 in the organisation University3, `` is preferred to ``The context collaboration holds between Wendy_Mitchell, create, and dataset4 in the organisation University1, `` because: audit is preferred to collaboration. 
The relation ``The organisation University3 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role wp_leader, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University2 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role associate_professor, `` because: wp_leader is preferred to associate_professor. 
The relation ``The context audit holds between Wendy_Mitchell, create, and dataset4 in the organisation University3, `` is preferred to ``The context collaboration holds between Wendy_Mitchell, create, and dataset4 in the organisation University2, `` because: audit is preferred to collaboration. 
The relation ``The organisation University1 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role wp_leader, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University1 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role secondee, `` because: wp_leader is preferred to secondee. 
The relation ``The context audit holds between Wendy_Mitchell, create, and dataset4 in the organisation University1, `` is preferred to ``The context collaboration holds between Wendy_Mitchell, create, and dataset4 in the organisation University1, `` because: audit is preferred to collaboration. 
The relation ``The organisation University1 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role wp_leader, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University1 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role associate_professor, `` because: wp_leader is preferred to associate_professor. 
The relation ``The context audit holds between Wendy_Mitchell, create, and dataset4 in the organisation University1, `` is preferred to ``The context collaboration holds between Wendy_Mitchell, create, and dataset4 in the organisation University1, `` because: audit is preferred to collaboration. 
The relation ``The organisation University1 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role wp_leader, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University2 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role associate_professor, `` because: wp_leader is preferred to associate_professor. 
The relation ``The context audit holds between Wendy_Mitchell, create, and dataset4 in the organisation University1, `` is preferred to ``The context collaboration holds between Wendy_Mitchell, create, and dataset4 in the organisation University2, `` because: audit is preferred to collaboration. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Wendy_Mitchell to perform create on dataset4 is granted. 
**Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.";2164;221;"**Decision Rule:** Access is granted only if there is a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohibition support.
**Outcome:** The permission is granted.
**Relations and Preferences:**
* **Role Preference:** ""The organization University3 employs Wendy_Mitchell as wp_leader"" is preferred over ""The organization Consortium employes Wendy_ Mitchell as secondee"".
* **Context Preference:** The context audit ""holds"" between Wendy_ Mitchell, create and dataset4 is preferred to the context collaboration ""holds"" in the organization University1.
* **Other Elements:** All other elements are identical between the permission and prohibition, so no preference comparisons are needed.

**Explanation:**
The decision is based on the logic that access is granted only when there is a supporting permission that dominates the prohibiting element. In this case, the ""wp_leader"" role is preferred over the ""secondee"", and the ""context audit"" holds between Wendy Mitchell, ""create"" and ""dataset4"" is preferred than the ""context collaboration"" between Wendy Mitchell and ""create"" in the University1.
