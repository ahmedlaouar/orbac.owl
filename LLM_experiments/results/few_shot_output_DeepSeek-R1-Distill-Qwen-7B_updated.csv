### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if for every support in the prohibition, there's a matching support in the permission where each element of the permutation is strictly preferred to the corresponding prohibition element.

**Outcome:**  
The access is granted for Amelia_King due to the dominance of permission elements over prohibition elements.

**Relations and Preferences:**  
- **Role Preference:** Researcher > PhDStudent, Full Professor > PostDoc, Coordinator > PhDStudent.  
- **Context Preference:** Management > Default, Secondment > Default.  
- **View Match:** WP4, WP1, and public_data align with deliverable1 in respective contexts.

        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

**Decision Rule:** Access is granted if, for each element in the support of a Prohibition, there is a corresponding element in the support that is strictly preferred to it in the Permission's support.

**Outcome:** The access is granted.

**Relations and Preferences:**

1. **Role Preferences:**
   - The role ""researcher"" in Institute3 is preferred over ""post_doc"" in Institute2.
   - The role remains ""researcher"" when compared to ""secondee"" in Institute2.

2. **Context Comparisons:**
   - ""Audit"" context in Institute3 is more stringent than ""collaboration"" in Institute2, making it preferred.
   - ""Auditing"" context is preferred over ""collaboration"".

3. **Other Shared Elements:**
   - Both the Permission and Prohibition share the same activities (consult) and data (public_data, confidential_data, contracts), so no additional preferences are needed for these.

**Conclusion:** All required conditions are met, so access is granted.";0.8511932373046875;0.9879150390625;0.9879150390625;0.355712890625;0.94775390625;0.0233306884765625;0.9846153846153847;31.99;12.3;12.6;13.7;15.19;15.3

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if, for each element in the prohibition's supporting conditions, there exists a strictly preferred element in the permission's supporting conditions.

**Outcome:**  
The access is granted because Mia_Anderson can perform the modify action on dataset6.

**Relations and Preferences:**

1. **Role Assignment:**

### Output:";2005;266;"

**Decision Rule**:  
The access is granted if each support of the prohibited activity is dominated by a corresponding support of the permitted activity. Dominance is established when each element in the permitted activity's support is strictly preferable to the corresponding element of the prohibited activity's support.

**Outcome**:  
The access request is granted because the permitted support dominates the prohibited support.

**Details**:  
1. **Dominance Check**:  
   - **Role Comparison**: The role ""coordinator"" in the permitted support is preferred over ""associate_professor"" in the prohibited support.  
   - **Context Comparison**: The context ""management"" in the permitted side is preferred over ""collaboration"" in the prohibited side.  
   
2. **Specific Element Match**:  
   - The element ""drop"" in both the permitted and prohibited supports is identical, thus no additional preference is required.  

3. **Other Elements**:  
   - Both the permitted and prohibited activities involve using ""dataset5"" in the view ""WP5"" or ""WP2"", which are identical and do not affect the dominance.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   - Since all required elements in the permitted support are strictly preferred over their counterparts in the prohibited support, the access for ""Liam_Taylor to modify dataset5"" is granted.";0.6394363403320312;0.4208984375;0.23233795166015625;0.94873046875;0.96875;0.37353515625;0.9613259668508287;15.31;16.6;15.16;18.0;15.9;18.8

        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports:

        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1399;322;"

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if, for every element in the support of a prohibition (Prohibition), there exists a corresponding element in the permission's support (Permission) where the permission's element is strictly preferred to the prohibition's element.

**Outcome:**  
The access is granted because all elements of the Permission's support are either strictly preferred to or match those of the Prohibition's support.

**Relations and Preferences:**  
1. **Role Assignment:**  
   - The role wp_leader (University2) is preferred over post_doc (University3) because wp_leader > post_doc.  
   - This preference is based on the role hierarchy where wp_leader is higher than post_doc.  

2. **Context Support:**  
   - Context audit (University2) holds between Alice-Johnson, copy=copy, and report6.  
   - Context collaboration (University3) holds between the same individuals and resources.  
   - Audit is preferred over collaboration because audit > collaboration.  

3. **Other Elements:**  
   - Both the Permission and Prohibition share the following elements:  
     - The organization University2 considers copy as a modification activity.  
     - The organizations University2 and University3 both use report6 in their respective views (administration and data).  
   - These shared elements do not require any preference comparison as they are identical.  

**Conclusion:**  
Since all elements in the Permission's support meet the dominance condition relative to the Prohibition's elements, the access is granted for Alice-Johnson to perform the modification of copy on report6.";0.83076171875;0.6334228515625;0.6334228515625;0.95263671875;0.94775390625;0.013427734375;0.9485981308411215;20.48;14.6;13.07;16.0;17.63;17.7

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1596;228;"

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if, for each element in the prohibition support, there exists a strictly preferred element in the permission support.

**Outcome:**  
The access is granted because each element of the permutation support is strictly preferred compared to the corresponding elements of the prohibition support.

**Relations and Preferences:**

1. **Role Preference:**
   - ""OrganisationUniversity₁ employs Mia in role coordinator"" is preferred over ""organismInstitute₂ employs Mia in role staff_member"" because ""coordinator > staff_member.""

2. **Context Preference:**
   ```plaintext
   Context secondment (University₁) > Context collaboration (Institute₂)
   ```

3. **Other Elements:**
   - Both permutation and prohibition supports share:
     - Consideration of ""sign"" as a validate activity.
     - Use of ""dataset8"" in their respective views.
   - These elements are identical, so no preference is needed.

**Conclusion:**  
Since all elements of the permutation support are either strictly preferred or identical to the prohibition support, access for Mia Anderson to validate on dataset8 is permitted.";0.813726806640625;0.6348876953125;0.6348876953125;0.9482421875;0.8916015625;0.040985107421875;0.9530201342281879;13.24;15.3;13.37;15.2;18.04;17.9

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports:

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1877;358;"

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if, according to the given logic, for every support in the set of prohibitions (Proh), there is a corresponding support from the set of permissions (Perm) such that the support of Perm dominates the support of Proh.  

**Outcome:**  
The access is granted because for each support in Proh, there exists a dominant support in Perm.  

**Relations and Preferences:**  
1. **Role Preferences:**  
   - The role ""full_professor"" in Perm is preferred to ""associate_professor"" in Proh because full_professor is a higher academic rank.  
   - The roles in both Perm and Proh are the same (team_leader and full_professor), so no additional preference is needed for these roles.  

2. **Context Preferences (for Proh1 and Proh2):**  
   - For Proh1, the context ""secondment"" is preferred to ""collaboration"" because secondment is a more appropriate context for the operation.  
   - Similarly, the context ""audit"" in Proh2 is preferred to ""default"" (implied by the absence of audit in Proh2's description), as audit is a more suitable context.  

3. **Other Elements:**  
   - Both Perm and Proh share elements such as the organization University1 considering ""ask"" as a ""consult"" activity and using ""report2"" in the view. These elements are identical in both cases, so no preference is needed.  

**Conclusion:**  
Since all elements of the Perm's support are either strictly preferred to or match those in the Proh's support, access for Xander_Rодriguez to perform ""ask on report2"" is granted.";0.8330973307291668;0.900390625;0.5752766927083334;0.9541015625;0.9228515625;0.1871337890625;0.935064935064935;40.08;13.3;14.0;14.3;12.54;15.8

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if, for each element in the support of a Prohibition, there exists a strictly preferred element in the corresponding element of the Permission's support.  

**Outcome:**  
The access is granted because all elements of the Permission’s support are either strictly preferred or identical to the corresponding elements in the Prohibition’s support.  

**Relations and Preferences:**  
1. **Role Preferences:**  
   - The role ""coordinator"" is preferred over ""secondee"" in the context of the organization Institute2.  
   - This preference is based on the role hierarchy where ""coordinator"" has higher priority than ""secondee"".  

2. **Context Preferences:**  
   – The context ""secondment"" is preferred over the context ""collaboration"" within the organization Institute2 and University3.  
   - ""Secondment"" is considered a higher priority context compared to ""collaboration"".  

3. **Other Elements:**  
   - Both the Permission and Prohibition share the following elements:  
     - The organization Institute2 considers ""sign"" as a validate activity.  
     - The same organization uses ""dataset4"" in the view ""WP1"".  
   - These shared elements do not require any preference comparison as they are identical in both supports.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1909;227;"

### Decision Rule:
An access is granted if, for each element in the support of a Prohibition, there is a corresponding support in the Permission where each element of the Permission is strictly preferred to the corresponding element in the Prohibition.

### Outcome:
The access is granted because all elements of the Permission's support are either strictly preferred to or equal to the corresponding elements in the Prohibition's support.

### Relations and Preferences:
1. **Role Preferences**:
   - The role ""researcher"" in Institute1 is preferred to ""post_doc"" in Institute2.
   - The role remains ""researcher"" when comparing Institute1 and Institute2 for the same context.

2. **Context Comparisons**:
   - ""Secondment"" is preferred to ""collaboration"" in Institute1.
   - ""Default"" is less preferred than ""secondment"" in Institute2.

3. **Other Elements**:
   - Both permissions share ""sign"" as a validate activity.
   - Both permissions use ""agreement3"" in their respective views.

Since all elements meet the dominance criteria, access is granted.";0.751580810546875;0.9281005859375;0.783233642578125;0.31005859375;0.8046875;0.06817626953125;0.9738562091503268;39.94;11.3;12.43;14.7;14.78;14.5

        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

**Decision Rule:** Access is granted if, for every element in the support of a prohibition (prohibiting action), there exists a corresponding element in the permission's support that is strictly preferred to it. This ensures that the permission's support entirely dominates the prohibition's.

**Outcome:** The access is granted. 

**Relations and Preferences:**
- **Role Assignment:** The role ""team_leader"" in Institute2 is preferred over ""post_doc"" in Institute3 because ""team_leader"" is considered higher than ""post_doc"".
- **Context:** The context ""audit"" is preferred over ""default"" because ""audit"" is more stringent than ""default"".
- **Other Elements:** Both the permission and prohibition share the same elements regarding the modification of ""drop"" and the use of ""report3"", so no additional preference is needed.

 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1400;322;"

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if, for every element in the support of a prohibition (prohibiting action), there exists a corresponding element in the permission's support that is strictly preferred to it. This means that each element in the permission must be strictly preferred compared to the corresponding element in the prohibition.

**Outcome:**  
The access is granted for Frank_Harris performing the action consult on dataset3.

**Relations and Preferences:**  
1. **Role Preference:**  
   - The role ""team_leader"" is preferred over ""secondee"" because ""team_leader"" has higher precedence.  
   - This is evident from the fact that Frank_Harris is assigned to ""team_leader"" in the permission, which is preferred over being assigned to ""secondee"".  

2. **Context Preference:**  
    - The context ""secondment holds"" is preferred over the context ""default holds"".  
    - This is because ""secondment"" is a more specific and appropriate context for the action being performed.  

3. **Other Elements:**  
    - Both the permission and prohibition share the following elements:  
        - The organization Institute1 considers ""ask"" as a consult activity.  
        - The same organization Institute1 uses ""dataset3"" in the view WP/contracts.  
    - These shared elements do not require any preference comparison as they are identical in both the permission and prohibition.  

**Conclusion:**  
Since all elements of the permutation's support are either strictly preferred to or identical to the corresponding elements in the prohibits' support, the access is granted.";0.79853515625;0.7666015625;0.7666015625;0.923828125;0.80029296875;0.2646484375;0.9592760180995475;36.49;12.6;12.19;14.9;15.19;16.0

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2214;249;"

**Decision Rule**:  
The access is granted if, for each Prohibition support (e.g., the context collaboration), there exists a corresponding Permission support (e.g.: the context audit) where each element in the Permission support is strictly preferred compared to the corresponding element in the Prohibition support.

**Outcome**:  
Access is granted because for each Prohibition's support, there exists a Permission's support where each element is strictly preferred. This satisfies the dominance condition.

**Relations and Preferences**:  
- **Role Preferences**:  
  - ""The organisation institute3 employs Dylan_nelson..."" is preferred over ""The organisation institute1..."" because researcher > PhD_student.  
  - ""Context audit"" is preferred over ""context collaboration"" because audit > collaboration.  
  - Similar preferences apply for other roles (team_leader, full_professor) and contexts (management, secondment).  

- **Context Preferences**:  
  All contexts (audit, management, secondment) are preferred over collaboration.  

- **Consortium Preferences**:  
  The use of ""move"" and ""dataset3"" is consistent across all, so no additional preference is needed.  

All elements meet the strict preference criteria, leading to the access decision.";0.5945882161458333;0.312408447265625;0.24085489908854166;0.81689453125;0.93896484375;0.336181640625;0.949685534591195;17.4;13.7;12.32;13.9;18.77;17.5

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

Access is granted if, for each element in a prohibition's support, there exists a strictly preferred element in the corresponding permission's support.  

**Outcome:**  
The access is granted because each element in the permutation's support is either strictly preferred to or matches the corresponding element in the prohibited support.  

**Relations and Preferences:**  
1. **Role Preferences:**  
   - The role ""researcher"" in the University3 is preferred to ""secondee"" in the Institute2 and Institute1.  
   - Similarly, ""coordinator"" in the Institute3 is preferred over ""secondee"".  

2. **Context Preferences:**  
   Specific contexts like ""audit"", ""secondment"", and ""management"" are preferred over ""default"".  

3. **Activity and View Consistency:**  
   The activities (validate) and views (confidential_data, data, internal_data) remain consistent across supports, ensuring no preference conflict.  

**Conclusion:**  
All elements in the permission's supports are either strictly preferred to those in the prohibitions or identical, satisfying the dominance condition.

The access is granted because all elements of the Permission's support are either strictly preferred to or match those of the Prohibition's support.

3. **Details Of The Analysis**

   a. **Analyze Each Proihilation-Support And Corresponding Permutation-Support**

      i. **Proh-Sup 1**:
         - The organization University2 employs Wendy_Mitchell as a role wp_leader.
         - This is preferred to the University1's role associate_professor.
         - The other elements (employing move, using agreement4, and context audit) match the corresponding elements in the Permission-Sup 1.

      ii. **Permit-Sup 1**: 
         - The same elements as Proh-Sup1 are matched by the Permission-Sup1, ensuring dominance.

      iii. **Proh Suppor 2**:
         - Similar to Proh-Supl, but with the role being post_doc in University1.
         - The employment of Wendy_Mitchell is preferred to the post_doc role in University1.

      iv. **Permit Suppor 2**: 
         - Matches the Proh Suppor2, maintaining dominance.

      v. **Proh_Supp3**:
         - Wendy_Mitchell's role as post_doc in UniversityI is preferred to the same role in University1.
         
      vi. **Permit_Supp3**: 
         - Same as Proh_Supp3, thus maintaining dominance.

      vii. **Proh-4**:
         - Role secondee in University1 is preferred to Bob's role.
         - Other elements match the Permission-Supp4.

      viii. **Permit-4**: 
         - All elements match, ensuring dominance.

     ix. **Proh_5**:
         - Employment in Team_leader role in Institute3 is preferred to the associate_professor role in UniversityI.
         
     x. **Permit_5**: 
         - Matched by the PhD_student role in Institute3, maintaining dominance.

   b. **Check For Dominance For Each Proh And Perim Suppair**

      i. For Proh-Sup I and Perim-Sup I:
         - Each element in the Proh-Sup is dominated by the corresponding element in the Perim-Sup.

      ii. Similarly, for Proh-Sup 2 and Perim-SUp2, dominance is met.

      iii. Proh-Supp3 and Perim-Supp3: Dominance holds.

      iv. Prohi-4 and Permi-4: All elements match, so dominance is satisfied.

      v. Prohi-5 and Permi-5: Dominance is met due to the role preference.

   c. Conclusion on Access Granting:
      - All Proh-Sup elements are dominated by their corresponding Perim-Sup elements, thus access is granted.

4. **Finla Conclusion**: The access Is granted because all elements in the Proh Supports are dominated by the corresponding elements In the Perim Supports, satisfying the dominance condition.";0.5918112182617188;0.6077346801757812;0.5471221923828125;0.61328125;0.74072265625;0.5498046875;0.8708010335917313;40.65;11.0;9.47;13.6;14.09;13.8

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support:

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";2194;212;"

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if for every Prohibition's support, there exists a Permission's support where each element of the latter is strictly preferred over its corresponding element in the former.

**Outcome:**  
Access is allowed because each Prohibition's support is dominated by a corresponding Permission's support.

**Details:**  
1. **Prohibition Support 1:**  
   - Institute2 grants staff_member to modify 'reports' with collaboration context.  
   - **Permission Support 1:** Institute3 grants wp_leader to modify 'deliverables' with audit context.  
     - wp_leader (I3) > staff_member (I2)  
     - audit > collaboration  
     - 'deliverables' > 'reports'  
     - audit context > collaboration context  

2. **Prohibition Supports 2 & 3:**  
   - These are similarly matched by their respective Permission Supports (2 & 3) with higher preferences across roles and contexts.  

Thus, all Prohibitions are dominated by Permissions, granting access.";0.36907958984375;0.0999298095703125;0.0834808349609375;0.1531982421875;0.9814453125;0.47265625;0.9147286821705426;20.79;14.5;12.85;15.0;18.33;18.9

### Output:";1598;321;"

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if, for each element in the support of a prohibition (Prohibition), there exists a corresponding element in the support part of a permission (Permission) where the permission's element is strictly preferred to the prohibition's element.

**Outcome:**  
The access is granted because Rachel_Baker is granted the permission to perform the modify activity on report2 based on the dominance of her role and the context.

**Relations and Preferences:**  
1. **Role Preferences:**  
   - The role ""full_professor"" is preferred over ""staff_member"" because full_professor is a higher academic rank.  
   - This preference is evident in the relations where University2 employs Rachel_Baker as a full_professor, which is preferred over Institute2's staff_member role.  

2. **Context Preferences:**  
    - The context ""audit"" is preferred over the context ""collaboration"" because audit is a more stringent requirement.  
    - This preference is reflected in the contexts where University2 has the audit context, which is more restrictive than the collaboration context in Institute2.  

3. **Other Elements:**  
   - Both the permission and prohibition share the same elements regarding the modification of ""drop"" and the use of ""report2"" in their respective views.  
   - These shared elements do not require any additional preference checks as they are identical in both supports.  

**Conclusion:**  
Since all elements of the permutation's support are either strictly preferred to or identical to the corresponding elements in the prohibitions' support, the access is granted.";0.86546630859375;0.74713134765625;0.74713134765625;0.962890625;0.94384765625;0.07366943359375;0.9691629955947136;23.66;15.4;14.81;16.6;15.66;18.1

### Output:";1806;1800;"Okay, so I need to figure out whether access is granted or denied based on the given logic, supports for permission and prohibition, and the preferences between their elements. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the overall logic says that access is granted if, for each prohibition support, there's a corresponding permission support where the permission's elements are strictly preferred to the prohibition's. So, I need to check each support in the prohibitions and see if there's a matching or better support in the permissions.

Looking at the input, there are three supports in the prohibitions (support 1, 2, 3) and one support in the permissions (support 1). Wait, actually, the permissions have only one support, but the prohibitions have three. Hmm, that might be a problem because the rule says for each support in the prohibition, there needs to be a corresponding support in the permission. If the permissions have fewer supports than the prohibitions, does that mean access is denied? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Wait, let me check the details again. The permissions have support 1, and the prohibitions have support 1-3. So, for each of the three prohibitions, I need to find a corresponding permission. But the permissions only have one support. That seems like a mismatch. Maybe I need to see if the single permission support can cover all the prohibitions? Or perhaps the logic is that for each prohibition, there's at least one permission support that dominates it, regardless of how many there are.

Wait, the example given had the same number of supports in both permission and prohibition. Maybe in this case, since the permissions have only support 1, but the prohibptions have three, it's impossible for each prohibition to have a corresponding permission. So, access might be denied. But I'm not sure. Let me think more carefully.

Alternatively, maybe the permissions have multiple supports, but in this input, they only have one. So, perhaps the decision is that since the number of permission supports is less than the number of prohibition supports, the condition isn't met, and access is denied. But I need to be precise.

Wait, the decision in the example had the same number, and it was granted. So, perhaps in this case, with more prohibitions than permissions, it's denied. Or maybe the logic is that each prohibition must be dominated by at least one permission, but if there are more prohibitions, it's still possible as long as each is dominated by some permission, even if the number of permissions is less.

But in this case, the permissions only have support 1. So, unless all three prohibitions are dominated by support 1 of the permission, it's okay. Let me check.

Looking at the permissions' support 1:

- The organization Institute2 gives Rachel_Baker the permission to consult on view WP5 if context secondment holds.
  - Elements: Institute2, role team_leader, consult, WP5, context secondment.

The prohibitions have three supports:

1. Support 1: Organization Institute1 grants PhD_student the prohibition to consult on WP1 if context default holds.
2. Support 2: Organization University3 grants PhD_student to consult on public_data with context default.
3. Support 3: Organization University2 grants associate_professor to consult on public_date with context default.

So, for each of these three prohibitions, we need to find a permission support (only support 1 exists) that dominates it.

So, let's see if the permission support 1 dominates each of the three prohibited supports.

To dominate, each element in the permission's support must be strictly preferred to the corresponding element in the prohibition.

Looking at each element:

1. Organization Institute2 vs. Institute1: Institute2 is better than Institute1? Or is it the other way around? Wait, in the preferences, it's stated that ""The relation 'The organisation Institute2 employs Rachel_Baker in role team_leader' is preferred to 'The organisation Institute1...' because team_leader is preferred."" So, Institute2 is better in terms of the role.

Similarly, for the context: the permission's context is secondment, which is preferred to default.

So, in the first prohibition support (support 1), the elements are:

- Institute1, PhD_student, consult, WP1, context default.

The permission support 1 has:

- Institute2, team_leader, consult (same), WP5, secondment.

So, comparing each element:

- Institute2 (I2) is preferred to Institute1 (I1) because of the role.
- The role is team_leader, which is preferred over PhD_student.
- consult is same.
- WP5 is same as WP1? Wait, no. WP5 vs WP1. Are they the same? No, they are different views. So, perhaps they are considered the same in this context? Or are they different?

Wait, in the permission support, it's consult on WP5, and in the prohibition support 1, consult on WP1. So, the view is different. Does that matter? In the example, they considered the same view, but here they are different. So, perhaps that's not a problem as long as the other elements are dominated.

But according to the dominance rule, each element in permission must be strictly preferred in at least one element. So, if the view is different, it might not be a problem, as long as other elements meet the criteria.

So, for the first prohibition support:

- I2 is better than I1 (role)
- team_leader is better than PhD_student (role)
- consult is same
- WP5 is similar to WP1? Not sure. Maybe it's considered the same or different. If it's the same, then it's a match. If not, it's okay as long as the others are covered.

But the context is secondment in permission, which is better than default in prohibition.

So, the permutation support 1 seems to dominate the first prohibition support.

Now, the second prohibition support is:

- Institute3, PhDStudent, consult, public_data, context default.

Permutation support 1 is:

- I2, team leader, consult (same?), public_data, secondment.

Wait, the view is public_data in both, so that's a match.

The role is team_leader in permission vs PhDStudent in prohibition. So, team_leader is preferred.

Institute is I2 vs I3. Is I2 preferred to I3? From the preferences, I don't see a direct comparison between I2 and I1 or I3. The only role preference is team_leader over PhDStudent.

So, in this case, for the second prohibition support, the permutation support has:

- I2 preferred to whatever I3 is (but I don't know if I2 is preferred to I3)
- team_leader preferred to PhDStudent
- consult same
- public_data same
- context secondment preferred to default

But since I don't know the preference between I2 and U3, maybe it's not a problem because the other elements are sufficient.

Wait, but the dominance requires that each element in permission is strictly preferred in at LEAST one element. It doesn't require that all elements are preferred, just that for each element in the prohibition, at least one element in the permission is preferred.

Wait, no, the dominance is that each element of permission is strictly preferred compared to the corresponding in the prohibition. So, for all elements in the permission, each must be strictly preferred compared to at least one in the prohibition.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Dominance is defined as: each element of permission's support is *strictly preferred* to at least ONE element in the corresponding prohibition's support.

Wait, no. The definition says: ""each element of the permission’s support is strictly preferred... to at least one"" — wait, the exact wording is: ""each element ... is strictly preferred to AT LEAST ONE element of the prohibition’s support.""

Wait, no, let me check:

The dominance means that: Each element of the permission’ s support is strictly preferred TO AT LEAST ONE ELEMENT OF THE PROHIBITION’ S SUPPORT.

Wait, that would mean that for each permission element, it's strictly preferred to some element in the prohibition. But the way it's phrased is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, it could mean that for each element p in the permission, there exists an element q in the prohibition such that p is strictly preferred to q.

But in the example, it's about the entire support being dominated. So, for the entire support of permission to dominate the entire support of prohibition, each element of the";0.37009684244791663;0.6396891276041666;0.6396891276041666;0.11456298828125;0.427734375;0.97119140625;0.9918397626112759;57.57;8.6;7.38;12.1;10.9;10.0

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if, for every element in the support of a prohibition (prohibiting element), there exists a corresponding element in the support permitted by the permission (permitted element) where the permitted element is strictly preferred to the prohibiting element.  

**Outcome:**  
The access is granted because all elements of the permutation's support are either strictly preferred to or identical to the corresponding elements in the prohibitions' support.  

**Relations and Preferences:**  
1. **Role Assignment:**  
   - Permitted Element: The organization University1 employs Paul_Harris in roles wp_leader.  
   - Prohibiting Element: The organization Institute2 employs Paul_Harry in roles secondee.  
   - Preference: wp_leader is more preferred than secondee.  

2. **Context:**  
   - Permit Element: The context audit holds among Paul_Harry, list, deliverable1 in University1.  
   - Forbidden Element: The context collaboration holds among Paul_Harri, list, deliverablen1 in Institute2.  
   - Prefernce: Audit is more preferred than collaboration.  

Other Shared Elements:

### 1. Decision Rule:  
The access is granted if, for every Prohibition support, there exists a matching Permission support where each element of thePermission's support is more preferred than the corresponding element in the Prohibition.

### 2. Outcome:  
Access is granted.

### 3. Details and Preferences:

#### a. Prohibition Supports and Corresponding Permissions:
1. **Prohibition Support 1**:
   - **Relation**: The organization University1 employs Amelia_King as an associate_professor to modify the view public_data with context collaboration.
   - **Corresponding Permission Support**: The same role in University1 but as a full_professor, using the same view and context.
   - **Preference**: full_professor > associate_professor, audit > collaboration.

2. **Prohibition Supports 2 & 3**:
   - These involve post_doc and PhD_student roles, which are less preferred than full_professor.

3. **Other Elements**:
   - Both permissions and prohibitions share the same activities (considering edit as modify and using deliverable1 in views WP1, WP4, and WP3), so no additional preference is needed.

#### b. Preferences Explained:
- **Role Preferences**: full_professor is more preferred than associate_professor, post_doc, and PhD_student.
- **Context Preferences**: audit is more preferred than collaboration and secondment.

#### c. No Conflicts:
- All elements in the permission are either more preferred or identical to the prohibition, satisfying the dominance condition.

#### d. Conclusion:

An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision:

### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";2240;1801;"1. **Decision Rules:** Access is granted if for each support of prohibited actions, there exists a supporting permission whose elements are strictly preferred to the prohibited's. 2. **Outcomes:** The access is granted. 3. **Details:**
   a. For each support of the prohibited action, identify the corresponding supporting permission and explain why the dominance conditions are met.
   b. List all the relations and their preferences that were considered. 4. **Conclusion:** Based on the above, the access is granted.

Okay, so I need to figure out why the access was granted in this given scenario. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the overall logic says that access is granted if for every support in the prohibited actions, there's a corresponding support in the permission that dominates it. Dominance here means each element in the permission's support must be strictly preferred to some element in the prohibited's support.

Looking at the input, there are two main parts: the supports of permission and the supports of prohibition.

Starting with the supports of permission, there are two supports:

1. Support 1: 
   - Organizational University1 grants Yara_Lee the permission to consult on view data if context audit holds.
   - University1 employs Yara_Lee as a role coordinator.
   - Considers grep as a consulting activity.
   - Uses report7 in view data.
   - Context audit holds between Y, grep, report7 in University1.

2. Support 2: 
   - Similar but for University2, role team_leader, uses report7 in deliverables, context management holds.

Then, the supports of prohibition have three supports:

1. From Institute3: Prohibits Yara_Lee from consulting on view WP1 if context default holds.
2. From University2, secondee role: Prohibits consulting on view WP2 with context default.
3. From University1, PhD student role: Proibits consulting on view deliverables with context default.

Now, the preferences are based on roles and contexts. For example, coordinator is preferred over staff_member, audit is preferred over default, etc.

So, for each prohibition support, we need to find a permission support that dominates it.

Looking at the first prohibition support (Institute3, context default), the corresponding permission support is University1's role coordinator. The role ""coordinator"" is preferred over ""staff_member,"" and the context ""audit"" is preferred over default. So, this support is dominated.

Similarly, the second prohibition support (University2, seconder, context default) is dominated by University2's role team_leader. Team_leader is preferred over secondee, and context management is preferred over default.

The third prohibition support (University1, PhD student, context default) has a corresponding permission support from University1's role PhD_student? Wait, no. Wait, the permission support for PhD_student is actually a prohibition. Wait, let me check.

Wait, the supports of permission are two: one for role coordinator in University1, another for team_leader in University2. The supports of prohibition include a third one for PhD_student in University1. So, for each of the three prohibition supports, we have to find a corresponding permission support.

Wait, the first two prohibitions are in University1 and University2, and the third is also in University1. The permissions have two supports: one in University1 (coordinator) and one in University2 (team_leader). So, the third prohibition in University1 (PhD student) needs to be matched with a permission in University1. But the permission in University1 is for role coordinator, not PhD_student.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the input.

In the input, the permissions have two supports:

- Support 1: University1, role coordinator, consult on view data, uses report7, context audit.

- Support 2: University2, role TL, consult on view deliverables, uses report7.

The prohibitions have three supports:

- Institute3: staff, consult on WP1, context default.

- University2: secondee, consult on WP2, context default.

Wait, no, the prohibitions are:

1. Institute3: staff...
2. University2: secontee...
3. University1: PhD student...

So, for each of these three prohibitions, we need to see if there's a corresponding permission.

But the permissions are only two: University1's role coord and University2's role TL.

So, perhaps the third prohibition (PhD student in University1) doesn't have a corresponding permission, but wait, the output says the access is granted. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the output says ""the access is granted"" but the details mention three prohibitions. Maybe the third prohibition doesn't have a matching permission, but the other two do. Or perhaps the third prohibition is about a different thing.

Wait, looking back, the third prohibition support is about PhD student, but the permissions have a role for PhD student? No, the permissions are for role coordinator and team_leader. So, perhaps the PhD student's prohibition is not matched with any permission, but the output says access is granted. That seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe the third prohibition is for a different activity. Let me check the details.

In the third prohibition support, it's about PhD student, consult on deliverables, context default. The corresponding permission would be the role PhD student, but in the permissions, there's a support for role PhD_student. Wait, yes, in the permissions, support 3 is for role PhD_student, but in the input provided, the permissions only have two supports, not three. Wait, no, in the input, the permission has two supports: one for role coord in U1, one for TL in U2. There's no support for PhD_student in the permissions.

Wait, perhaps I misread the input. Let me check again.

In the input for permissions, there are two support 1 and 2. The third support is a prohibition. So, the third support in the prohibitions is about PhD student in U1, but there's no corresponding permission for that. So, how can the access be granted?

Wait, maybe the access is granted because for each prohibition, there's a permission that dominates it, except the third one, but perhaps the third one isn't a problem because it's about a different context or something.

Wait, perhaps the third prohibits the PhD student, but since there's no permission for PhD student, it doesn't affect the decision. Or maybe the third prohibition doesn’t have a corresponding permission because the permission for PhD student is not present, so it's not considered. But the output says the decision is granted, so perhaps the third prohibition isn't part of the evaluation.

Alternatively, perhaps the third support is not a prohibition but a permission. Wait, no. Looking back, the third support is listed under the 'Supports of Proihilation' section, so it's a prohibition.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, the decision rule is that for each support in the prohibited action, there must be a corresponding permission support where the permission's elements are strictly preferred. So, if there's a prohibition support that doesn't have a dominating permission, then access is denied.

But in the output, it's granted. So, perhaps all three prohibitions have corresponding permissions that dominate them.

Wait, the third prohibition is in U1, PhD_student, context default. Is there a corresponding permission in U1 for PhD_student? Looking back, the permissions have a support for role Phd_student? No, in the permissions section, the first support is role coord, second is TL. So, no, there's no support for Phd_student in the permissions. So, perhaps that's why the access is denied, but the output contradicts that.

Wait, perhaps my initial understanding is wrong. Maybe the third support is actually a permission, not a prohibition. Let me check.

No, the third support under 'Supports of Permutation' is a prohibition. It says: The organization University1... conside... So, it's a prohibition. So without a corresponding permission, the access should be denied. But the output states it's granted. That's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps in the input, there's a mistake. Maybe the third permutation is actually a permission. Or perhaps the user made a mistake in the input.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me try to parse the input correctly.

Looking back, the input has:

- Supports of permission: two supports.

- Supports of prohibition: three supports.

- Preferences between elements.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";2010;254;"

**Decision Rule:**  
An access is granted if, for each element in the prohibition's supports, there exists a supporting element in the permission's supports where the permission's element is strictly preferred to the corresponding prohibition's element.  

**Outcome:**  
The access is granted.  

**Details:**  
1. **First Prohibition Support:**  
   - **Role:** `secondee`, **Context:** `default`  
   - **Dominating Permission Support:**  
     - **Role:** Full Professor, **Context:** `audit`  
     - **Preferences:** `full_professor` > `secondee` and `audit` > `default`  
     - This support is dominated.  

2. **Second Prohibition Supports:**  
   - There are multiple supports in the prohibits, each requiring a corresponding permit support.  
   - Each support in the prohibits is matched with a permit support where the elements are strictly preferred.  

3. **Third Prohibition Support:** Similar to the first, matched with a dominating permit support.  

4. **Fourth Prohibition Support:** Matched with a permit support that meets the dominance criteria.

### Output:";2703;240;"

1. **Decision Rules**: The access is permitted if, for each prohibition's support, there's a corresponding permission's support where each element in the permission is strictly better than at least one element in the prohibition.

2. **Outcomes**: The access is approved because the permission's components dominate the prohibition's, with each element in the permit being strictly preferred.

3. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - Each permutation support has a corresponding prohibition support.
   - **Role Assignments**:
     - Institute2's full_professor role is preferred over University3's secondee.
     - Audit context is more favored than collaboration in Institute2.
   - **Other Elements**:
     - Both consult activities and view elements (cat and report6) align between permission and prohibition.
   - **Roles Across Different Contexts**:
     - Team_leader in University2 over secondee in various contexts.
     - Management in Institute1 over default in other contexts.
   - **Preference Hierarchy**:
     - Preferences like full_professor, team_leader, management, and audit guide the decision.
   - **Conclusion**: All dominance conditions are satisfied, thus access is granted.";0.7018622504340277;0.7339274088541666;0.5881279839409722;0.433837890625;0.98486328125;0.2314453125;0.9487179487179487;23.02;13.6;14.37;15.1;18.55;18.0

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

**Decision Rule:**  
The access is granted if, for each suppression in the prohibition, a corresponding suppression in the permission exists where each element of the permutation's support is strictly preferable to at least one component of the prohibition's suppression.

**Outcome:**  
The access to the activity is granted.

**Relations and Preferences:**

1. **Element-wise Preferences:**
   - **Role Preferences:**
     - The company XYZ's role manager is preferred to the company PQR's role senior.

### Output:";1839;316;"

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if, for every element in the support of a prohibition (ProH), there exists a corresponding element in the support from a permission (Perm) where the permission's element is strictly preferred to the prohibition's element.

**Outcome:**  
The access is granted because all elements of the permutation support are strictly preferred to the corresponding elements of the prohibition support.

**Relations and Preferences:**  
1. **Role Preferences:**  
   - The role ""full_professor"" is preferred over ""post_doc"" and ""staff_member"" because full_professor > post_doc and full_professor > staff_member.  
   - Specific instances:  
     - University1.full_professor is preferred over University2.post_doc and Institute3.post_doc and University3staff_member.  
2. **Context Preferences:**  
   Secondment is preferred over default and collaboration.  
   - The secondment context (between Isla_Martin、sign、report7 in University1) is preferred over the default context (between University2) and collaboration context (between Institute3).  
3. **Consortium Preferences:**  
   The organization University1's use of sign as validate is the same as University2 and Institute3, so no preference is needed.  
   The use of report7 in the views is also the same across all organizations, so no additional preference is required.  

**Conclusion:**  
Since all elements of the Permutation support are either strictly preferred or identical to the corresponding elements in the ProH support, the access is granted.";0.669775390625;0.5867919921875;0.5867919921875;0.93408203125;0.9609375;0.7197265625;0.9447236180904522;14.15;15.0;12.34;14.9;18.32;17.4

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if, for each prohibition's support, there exists a permission's support where each element of the permutation is strictly preferred to the corresponding element in the prohibition.

**Outcome:**  
The access is granted because each element in the permutation supports is strictly preferred over the corresponding elements in the prohibitions.

**Relations and Preferences:**

1. **Role Preferences:**
   - ""The organisation Institute2 employs Zane Gonzalez in the role team leader"" is preferred over ""The organisation University1 employs Zane Gonzalez..."" because team leader is preferred over PhD student.

2. **Context Preferences:**
   – ""The context management holds..."" is preferred over ""the context collaboration holds..."" because management is preferred.

3. **Other Elements:**
   - Both supports share ""The organisation considers 'grep' as a consult activity"" and ""uses report3 in the viewed reports."" These are identical, so no preference is needed.

**Conclusion:**  
Since all elements of the permutation supports are either preferred or identical to the prohibitions, access is granted.";0.6290435791015625;0.269287109375;0.2214508056640625;0.7998046875;0.95751953125;0.10284423828125;0.9551282051282052;31.99;12.3;11.57;13.7;15.71;15.2

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";2855;290;"

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if and solely if, for each individual element in the prohibition support, there exists a matching element in the permission support that is strictly preferred.  

**Outcome:**  
The access is granted because Isla_Martin is granted the permission to edit dataset8, with all corresponding elements in the permission support being strictly preferred to those in the prohibition support.  

**Relations and Preferences:**  
1. **Role Preferences:**  
   - `wp_leader` (University1) is preferred over `post_doc` (Institute3).  
   - `context secondment` is preferred over `context collaboration`.  
   - `role coordinator` is preferred in multiple contexts (Institute3, Institute2) over `post_doc`, `staff_member`, and `wp_leader`.  
   - Specific context preferences like `context audit` over `context default` and `context management` over `context collaboration` are also in place.  

2. **Context Preferences:**  
   Each context within the permissions (e.g., secondment, audit, management) is preferred over the corresponding contexts in the prohibitions (e.g., collaboration, default, default).  

3. **Matching Elements:**  
   Each element in the permission supports (roles and contexts) is matched with a more preferred element in the prohibition supports, ensuring dominance.

        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share:

### Output:";1600;328;"

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if, for each element in the support of a Prohibition, there exists a strictly preferred element in the corresponding element of the Permission's support.  

**Outcome:**  
The access is granted because all elements of the Permission’s support are either strictly preferred or identical to the corresponding elements in the Prohibition’s support.  

**Relations and Preferences:**  
1. **Role Preferences:**  
   - The role ""team_leader"" in the Permission is preferred to ""staff_member"" in the Prohibition.  
   - This is because ""team_leader"" is strictly preferred over ""staff_member"".  

2. **Context Preferences:**  
   – The context ""audit"" is preferred to ""collaboration"" and ""default"".  
   - ""Audit"" is preferred over ""collaboration"", and ""audit"" is also preferred over ""default"".  

3. **Other Elements:**  
   - Both the Permission and Prohibition share the following elements:  
     - The organization University1 considers ""sign"" as a validate activity.  
     - The organizations University1 and Institute1 both use ""dataset2"" in their respective views.  

4. **Preferences Summary:**  
   - ""team_leader"" > ""staff_member""  
   - ""audit"" > ""collillation""  
   - “audit” > “default”  
   - All other elements are identical and do not require a preference comparison.  

**Conclusion:**  
Since all elements of the Per mission's support are strictly preferred to or identical with those of the Prohibition's support, the access is granted.";0.34993896484375;0.137054443359375;0.137054443359375;0.51806640625;0.82763671875;0.8701171875;0.935;28.94;13.4;12.78;14.9;16.35;17.5

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]

### Output:";1911;282;"

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if, for each element in the support of a Prohibition, there exists a correspondingly preferred element in the Permission's support. Specifically, each element of the Permission's support must be strictly preferred compared to the corresponding element in the Prohibition's support.

**Outcome:**  
The access is granted for Mia_ANDERSON to perform SIGN on AGREEMENT2.

**Relations and Preferences:**  
1. **Role Preferences:**  
   - The role ""team_leader"" in Organisation University1 is preferred over ""PhD_student"" in Organisation Institute1.  
   - The same applies to ""researcher"" in Organisation Institute2 over ""associate_professor"" in both organisations.  

2. **Context Preferences:**  
    - ""secondment"" is preferred over ""collaboration"" in both contexts within Organisation University1 and Institute2.  
    - ""management"" is preferred over another unspecified context within Organisation Institute2.  

3. **Other Elements:**  
   - Both the Permission and Prohibition share elements like ""considering sign as a valid activity"" and ""using AGREEMENT2 in the view.""  
   - These shared elements do not require preference comparison as they are identical.  

**Conclusion:**  
Since all elements of the Permission’s support are either strictly preferred or identical to those in the Prohibition’s support, the access is granted.";0.811480712890625;0.81048583984375;0.641326904296875;0.96923828125;0.85107421875;0.2147216796875;0.9277777777777778;13.14;15.4;14.37;15.9;17.92;17.5

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

**Decision Rule**:  
The access is granted if, for every element in the Proihilation's support, there exists a matching element in the Permission's support where the Permission's element is strictly preferred to the Proihilation's element.

**Outcome**:  
Access is granted because the Permission's support elements are strictly preferred to the corresponding Proihilation's support elements.

**Relations and Preferences**:

1. **Role Preferences**:
   - **Frank_Harris in role researcher** is preferred over **Frank_Harris employed in secondee role** because researcher > secondee.
   - **Full_professor** is preferred over both **post_doc** and **associate_professor** because full_professor > post_doc and full_professor > associate_professor.
   - **Audits** are preferred over **collaborations** because audit > collaboration in all contexts.

2. **Context Preferences**:
   All context elements (Frank_Harris, add/modify, agreement3) remain identical across all supports, so no additional preference is needed.

3. **Other Considerations**:

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if, for each element in the prohibition's supports, there exists a strictly preferred element in the corresponding permission's support across all relevant aspects (role, context, etc.).

**Outcome:**  
The access is granted because all elements of the prohibition's supports are strictly preferred by the corresponding elements in their respective permission's supports.

**Relations and Preferences:**

1. **Role Preferences:**
   - **Permutation:** `team_leader` (Institute3) > `post_doc` (University2) > `PhD_student` (University3) > `secondee` (University2)
   - **Preferences:**
     - `Institute3` employs `David_Williams` in `team_leader` is preferred over `University2`'s `post_doc`.
     - `Institution3`'s `secondment` context is preferred over `Collaboration` and `default`.

2. **Context Comparisons:**
   - `secondment` in `Institute3`: preferred over `collaboration` in `University2` and `default` in `University3`.
   
3. **Activity Consideration:**
   - Both prohibitions and permissions consider `ask` as a `consult` activity, hence no preference needed.

4. **View Usage:**
   - In `Institute3`, `agreement1` is used in `WP2` (permission) and `internal_data` (prohibition). No preference as the same view is used.

**Conclusion:**  
Each element in the prohibitions is matched with a more preferred element in the permissions, satisfying the dominance condition.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1596;226;"

**Decision Rule:** Access is granted if, for each prohibition support, there exists a permission support where each element of the permutation is strictly preferred to the corresponding element in the prohibition.

**Outcome:** The access is granted for Chloe Walker to perform the edit on report3.

**Relations and Preferences:**

1. **Role Preferences:**
   - **Element:** ""The organization Institute2 employs Chloe_Walker in role team_leader.""
     - **Prefered Over:** ""The organization University3 employs Chloe Walker in role secondee.""
     - **Reason:** team_leader is preferred over secondee.

2. **Context Differences:**
   - ""The context management holds..."" is preferred to ""The context default holds..."" because management is preferred over default.

3. **Other Matching Elements:**
   - Both permit and prohibit share:
     - The organization Institute2 considers edit as modify.
     - Both use report3 in view WP2 or data.
   - No preference needed as they are identical.

**Conclusion:** All elements of the permission are either preferred or match the prohibition, so access is granted.";0.7157470703125;0.37188720703125;0.37188720703125;0.98828125;0.951171875;0.1044921875;0.9673202614379085;34.73;11.2;10.0;12.0;14.54;13.8

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support:

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if, for every element in the support of a prohibition (Prohibition), there exists a corresponding element in the permission's support (Permission) where the permission's element is strictly preferred to the prohibition's element.  

**Outcome:**  
The access is denied because the permission's elements do not dominate the prohibition's elements.  

**Relations and Preferences:**  
1. **Role Assignment:**  
   - **Permission Support Element:** The role associate_professor is granted by the organization Institute2.  
   - **Prohibition Support Element:** The same role is prohibited by the organization University3.  
   - Comparison: Institute2 is preferred over University3.  

2. **Context:**  
   - Both permissions and prohibitions share the same context (collaboration) involving Victor_Turner and report5.  

3. **Other Elements:**  
   - The activities (consult) and the view (data or public_data) are identical in both permission and prohibition.  
   - The organizations (Institute2, University1, University3) are compared, but since the roles and contexts are the same, they do not influence the decision.  

**Conclusion:**  
Since the permission's role is assigned by a less preferred organization (Institute2) compared to the prohibition's (University3), the dominance condition is not met.

### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied.

        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required.

### Output:";2211;1801;"1. **DecisionRule**: The access is granted if for each support of the Prohibition, there's a corresponding support of the Permission where the Permission's support dominates the Prohibition's. Dominance requires each element of the Permission's support to be strictly preferred over at least one element in the Prohibition's support. 2. **Outcomes**: Access is granted. 3. **Details**: For each Prohibition support, a corresponding Permission support exists where each element in the Permission is strictly preferred to the corresponding Prohibition element. Let's break it down:

Prohibition Support 1:
- The organization University1 employs PhD_student in the role.
- The organization uses sign as a valid activity.
- The context default holds among University1's employees.

Permitted Action:
- The organization Institute3 employs researcher in the role, which is preferred over PhD_student.
- The context management holds, which is better than default.

Prohibition Support 2:
- The organization I3 employs staff_member in the role, preferred over team_leader.
- Context default holds.

Permitted Action 2:
- Team_leader is preferred over staff_member in I2.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to figure this out step by step.
Okay, so I need to explain why the access was granted based on the given logic, supports, preferences, etc. Let me start by understanding the overall structure.

The decision rule is that access is granted if, for each Prohibition support (each element in the Prohibitions), there's a corresponding Permission support where each element in Permission is strictly preferred over the Prohibition's element.

Looking at the input, there are three Prohibition supports (support 1, 2, 3) and two Permission supports. Wait, no, actually, looking back, the input has two Supports of Permission (support 1 and 2) and three Supports of Prohibition (supports 1,2,3). Hmm, that might complicate things.

Wait, the example had one Prohibition support and one Permission support, and the decision was granted. Now, in this case, there are multiple Prohibitions and Permissions. So, the rule is that for every Prohibition support, there must be a corresponding Permission support that dominates it.

So, let's see:

Prohibition Supports:
1. University1 uses PhD_student with default context.
2. I3 uses staff_member with default context.
3. I1 uses associate_professor with default context.

Permission Supports:
1. Institute3 uses researcher with management context.
2. Institute2 uses team_leader with management context.

Wait, but the permissions have two supports, while the prohibitions have three. So, for each of the three Prohibitions, we need a corresponding Permission support. But there are only two Permissions. That seems problematic. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps each Prohibition support is matched with a Permission support. So, for the first Prohibition support (University1's PhD), we have a Permission support (Institute3's researcher). For the second Prohibition support (I3's staff), we have another Permission support (I2's team_leader). But what about the third Prohibition support? It's I1's associate_professor. There's no corresponding Permission support in the input. Hmm, that might be an issue.

Wait, looking back at the input, perhaps the number of supports is the same for both. Let me check:

In the input, the Supports of Permission have two supports: support 1 and support 2.

Similarly, the Supports of Prohibition have three supports: 1, 02, 03.

Wait, that can't be right because the decision rule says ""for each support of a Prohibition"", so if there are three Probinations, each must have a corresponding Permission support.

But in the input, the Permissions have two supports. So, perhaps the user made a mistake, or perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, let me re-examine the input:

Under ""Supports of Permission"", there are two supports: support1 and support2.

Under ""Supports_of_Prohibition"", there are three supports: 01,02,03.

So, for each of these three Prohibitions (01,0₂,03), we need to find a corresponding Permission support (either 1 or 2) that dominates it.

But since there are three Prohibitions and only two Permissions, perhaps one of the Prohibitions doesn't have a corresponding Permission, which would mean access is denied. But the outcome says access is granted. Hmm, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the Prohibitions are grouped, and each group is matched to a Permission. But that's not clear from the input.

Alternatively, maybe the number of Prohibitions is three, but the number of Permissions is two, but the decision is that for each Prohibition, there exists at least one Permission that dominates it. So, even if some Prohibitions don't have a matching Permission, as long as the ones that do have a Permission are dominated, it's okay. But the rule is ""for each Prohibition, a corresponding Permission exists that dominates it."" So, if any Prohibition does not have a corresponding Permission that dominates it, then access is denied.

But in the outcome, it's granted. So, perhaps all Prohibitions have a corresponding Permission.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me think again.

In the example given, there was one Prohibition and one Permission, and the outcome was granted because the Permission's support dominated the Prohibition's.

In the current input, there are two Permissions and three Prohibitions. So, perhaps for each of the two Permissions, they cover two of the three Proibitions, and the third Prohibition is covered by one of the Permissions.

Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each Permission can cover multiple Proibitions, as long as each Proibition is covered by at least one Permission.

But the rule is: for each Proibition, there exists a Permission where the Permission supports dominate the Proibition's.

So, each Proibition must have at least one Permission support that dominates its support.

So, in the current case, we have three Proibitions and two Permissions. So, each of the three Must be dominated by at least one of the two Permissions.

But how?

Let me list the Proibitions and Permissions:

Proibitions:

1. University1: PhD_student, sign as validate, report6 in view, context default.

2. I3: staff_member, sign validate, report6, context default.

3. I1: associate_professor, sign validate, ..., context default.

Permissions:

1. Institute3: researcher, sign validate, ... , context management.

2. Institute2: team_leader, sign validate, .., context management.

So, each of the Proibitions must be dominated by either Institute3's researcher support or Institute2's team_leader support.

So, for Proibition 1 (University1 PhD), the Permission support is Institute3 researcher, which is preferred to University1's PhD.

For Proibition 2 (I3 staff), the Permission is I2's team_leader, which is higher than I3's staff.

But wait, I3's staff is in I3, and I2's team leader is in I2, so the role is different. So, the relation between ""I3 employes staff in role"" and ""I2 employes team_leader"" is that team_leader is preferred over PhD, but in the same role? Or is it a different role?

Wait, the preferences are about the specific statements, not the roles. So, each element in the permission's support must be strictly preferred to the proibition's.

Looking at the relations:

- ""The organisation Institute3 employs ... researcher"" is preferred to ""The organisation University1 employs ... PhD_student"" because researcher > PhD.

- Similarly, ""I3 employs staff"" is preferred to I3's PhD, but wait, the Proibition is I3's staff, and the Permission is I3's researcher? Or is the Proibition in I3's staff and the Permission in I2's team?

Wait, the Proibitions are:

Proibition 1: I1's PhD

Proibition 2: I3's staff

Proibition3: I1's associate

The Permissions are:

Perm 1: I3's researcher

Perm2: I2's team

So, for Proi 1 (I1 PhD), the Perm1 (I3 researcher) is preferred.

For Proi2 (I3staff), the Perm2 (I";0.4680338541666666;0.6490885416666666;0.5619303385416666;0.258544921875;0.83154296875;0.9609375;0.9761316872427983;50.12;9.4;6.98;12.4;12.51;11.5

### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1383;263;"

**Decision Rule:** Access is granted if, for each element in the prohibition's supporting elements, there exists at least one element in the permission's supporting elements that is strictly preferred to it. This ensures that the permission's requirements are more favorable than the prohibition's.

**Outcome:** The access is granted for Wendy_Mitchel to perform the action 'add' on 'dataset6'.

**Relations and Preferences:**

- **Role Assignments:**
  - **Permission:** The organization University1 grants Wendy_Mitchell the role of researcher.
  - **Prohibition:** The organization Institute1 prohibits Wendy_Mitchell from performing the same role.
  - **Preference:** The role of researcher in University1 is preferred over the role of team_leader in University2.

- **Modification Activity:**
  - Both permissions and prohibitions consider 'add' as a modify activity.

- **Context:**
  - The context 'secondment holds' in University1 is stricter than the context 'management holds' in University2 and University3.

- **Other Elements:**
  - All other elements in both permissions and prohibitions are the same, hence no additional preferences are needed.

**Conclusion:** Since all elements in the permission's support meet the dominance condition over the prohibition's, access is granted.";0.59124755859375;0.058441162109375;0.058441162109375;0.98876953125;0.9228515625;0.072265625;0.9829545454545454;29.25;13.3;14.83;16.3;17.63;18.1

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if, for each prohibition's support, there exists a permission's support where each element is strictly preferred.  

**Outcome:**  
The access is granted because both prohibitions' supports are dominated by their corresponding permission supports.  

**Relations and Preferences:**  
- **Role Preferences:**  
  - `team_leader` (University1) is preferred over `post_doc` (University3).  
  - `coordinator` (Institute1 & University1) is preferred compared to `team_leader` & `post_doc`.  
- **Context Preferences:**  
  Audits are preferred over collaborations.  
- **Other Elements:**  
  Both permissions share `Quinn_Thomas`, `drop`, and `report3` with the same roles and contexts.

Now, I need to create a similar explanation for the given input. The input is about denying access for Olivia_Scott performing sign on report5.

Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the overall logic. The access is granted if, for each prohibition support, there's a corresponding permission support where the permission's elements are strictly preferred to the prohibition's.

So, the decision rule is: For each support in the prohibition, there must be a corresponding support in the permission where every element in the permission support is strictly preferred over the corresponding element in the prohibition support.

Now, looking at the input:

There are three supports for the prohibition (support 1, 2, 3) and presumably three supports for the permission. Wait, actually, the input doesn't list the supports of the permission. Hmm, wait, the user provided the input, but in the example, they had both supports for permission and prohibition. But in the current input, the user only provided the supports of the prohibition. Let me check the input again.

Wait, the user's input seems to have the same structure as the example. Let me see:

In the example, the user provided:

1. Overall Logic
2. Supports of Permission
3. Supports of Prohibition
4. Preferences Between the Elements
5. The Decision

But in the current problem, the user is providing the input as:

""Input: 1. Overall Logic... 2. Supports of Permi... etc."" So perhaps the user is asking me to process the given input and produce an output similar to the example.

Wait, the initial problem says:

""Input: ... [then the same detailed structure as the example] ... The Decision: The outcome is: the access is denied.""

So, the user is now providing the actual input data, and I need to process it and produce an output with the structured explanation.

So, the input is:

1. **OverallLogic:** Access is granted if for each support of prohibited, there's a permis support where permis's support dominates the prohibited's.

2. **Sup of Permission:** There are three supports, but the user didn't list them. Wait, in the example, the example input had three supports for both permission and prohibition.

Wait, in the example input, the user provided three supports for both. So, in the current problem:

The user's input has three supports for the Prohibition, but the user hasn't provided the corresponding three supports for the Permission. Wait, no, the user's ""Input"" seems to have three supports for the prohibited, but the user is now asking me to process that.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine the user's message.

The user wrote:

""Here is an example case...

### Example Input

1. Overall Logic...
2. Supports of Permision: [list]
3. Supports of Protection: [list]
4. Preferences...
5. The Decision: access granted.

Then, the user says:

""Please explain the decision making process... using the provided logic...""

But in the current query, the user writes:

""Input:1. Overall... 2. Sup of Permision... 3. Sup of Proh... 4. Preferences... 5. The Decision...""

So, the user wants me to process the input they've provided, which includes:

- Overall Logic
- Supports of Permission (three)
- Supports of Prohibition (three)
- Preferences
- Decision: access denied.

So, my task is to take this input and produce an explanation similar to the example, but explaining why the access is denied.

So, first, I need to structure the output as:

1. Decision Rule
2. Outcome
3. Relations and Preferences
   a. Permission Support Elements
   b. Prohibition Support Elements
   c. Preferences Between Elements
   d. Other Elements
   e. Conclusion

So, I need to analyze each of the three prohibitions and see if for each, there's a permutation support that dominates.

Wait, but the decision is that the access is denied. So, that means that for at least one of the prohibitions, there is no corresponding permission support that dominates it.

So, I'll need to go through each of the three supports of the prohibition and check if each has a corresponding permission support that satisfies the dominance condition.

If any of the prohibitions don't have such a corresponding support, then the access is denied overall.

So, let's look at the details.

First, let's parse the supports.

Supports of Permission (three):

Looking at the example, the permission supports are:

Support 1:
- The organization Institute1 grantees the role staff member the permission to perform the action validate on the viewWP4.
- The org. Institute1 employs OliviaScott in the role staff member.
- The org Considers sign as validate.
- The context collaboration holds among OliviaScott, sign, report5 in Institute1.

Similarly, support 2 and 3 are similar but for different views and roles.

Wait, but in the current problem's input, the user didn't provide the supports of the permissions. Wait, the user wrote:

In the Input section, the user lists:

2. **Support of Permi...**
   (support 1), (support 2), (support 3)

But the user didn't fill in the details. Wait, perhaps the user intended to provide the details, but in the initial prompt, the user included the example, but now the user is providing their own input.

Wait, perhaps the user is presenting the actual input data for the problem, so I need to process that.

But in the user's message, the input is structured as:

1. OverallLogic
2. Sup of Permission: three supports
3. Sup of Protections: three supports
4. Preferences
5. Decision: access denied

So, I think the user expects me to process this input and produce the structured output.

But in the current message, the user hasn't filled in the specific details for the supports of permission and prohibition. Wait, perhaps I misread the user's message. Let me check again.

The user wrote: ""Here is an example..."" then provided the example input. Then, the user says: ""Please explain the decision..."". Then, the user writes: ""Input:1. ... 2. ... 3. ... 4. ... 5. ..."". So, the user is giving me the actual input data to process, which includes the three supports of permission and three supports of prohibition, along with the preferences.

Wait, no, in the user's current message, the sections 2,3,4,5 are just headers, but the actual content is missing. So, perhaps the user forgot to include the specific data. Alternatively, perhaps the user provided the example input, and now is asking me to do the same for a different input.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to clarify.

In the initial example, the user presented a detailed input with all the sections filled. Now, the user is presenting a new input, but in their message, they only provided the headers, not the actual data. So, perhaps I need to ask for more information.

But since the user is expecting me to generate an output, perhaps I should assume that the user will provide the necessary data, but in this case, they haven't. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the example they provided, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in their message, and the actual input is the same as the example, but with different names. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps I should treat the user's current input as the actual data to process, even though the specific sections are missing.

Wait, perhaps it's better to proceed by assuming that the user provided the necessary data in the initial example, and now wants me to process a similar structure but with different data.

But without the specific data, I can't proceed. Therefore";0.595361328125;0.26318359375;0.26318359375;0.83544921875;0.9482421875;0.333251953125;0.9880149812734083;50.12;9.4;7.05;11.6;9.96;9.4

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if, for every element in the support of a permutation, it is strictly preferred to the corresponding element in the support associated with a prohibition.

**Outcome:**  
The access is granted because Wendy_Mitchell's permission to sign report2 meets the required conditions.

**Relations and Preferences:**  
- **Role Assignment:**  
  - **Permutation Support Element:** The role researcher in the organization University1 is assigned to Wendy_Mitchell.  
  - **Corresponding Prohibition Support Element:** Wendy_Mitchell is assigned to the role researcher in the organizations Institute1 and Institute3.  

- **Context Consideration:**  
  - The context management holds in University1, Institute1, and Institute3, involving Wendy_Mitchell and report2.  

- **Strict Preference:**  
  - In University1, the role researcher is preferred over full_professor in Institute1.  
  - In Institute1, the context audit holds compared to context management in University1.  

- **No Preference Needed:**  
  - Sign is considered a validate activity in all cases.  
  - report2 is used in all views.  

Conclusion:  
Since all elements of the permutation support are either strictly preferred to or equal to the corresponding elements in the prohibited support, the access is granted.";0.6003448486328125;0.115966796875;0.115966796875;0.98486328125;0.81005859375;0.0251312255859375;0.9548022598870056;20.79;14.5;13.63;15.9;17.8;17.7

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if for each support of the prohibition, there exists an element in the permission's support that is strictly preferred to the corresponding element in the prohibition's context.  

**Outcome:**  
The access is granted for Olivia_Scott due to the dominance of the permission's elements over the prohibition's.  

**Relations and Preferences:**  
1. **Roles and Contexts:**  
   - Olivia_Scott's role as a ""librarian"" is preferred to ""patient"" in the context ""emergency.""  
   - The context ""emergency"" is preferred to the prohibited ""afternoon"" within the same organization.  

2. **Specific Activity and View:**  
   - The permission to handle ""delegate"" on the view preserves_3 is granted, dominating the prohibited ""handle"" on admin_data in the afternoon context.  

3. **Context Preferences:**  
   - ""Emergency"" context is preferred to ""afternoon,"" ensuring the dominance of the permissible action over the prohibited one.  

4. **Dominance Check:**  
   - Each element in the permission (e.g., ""librarian handling delegate"") is strictly preferred to its corresponding element in the prohibits (e.g., ""... patient"").  
   - Contexts (""emergency"" vs. ""afternoon"") ensure the dominance condition is met.";0.6207509358723958;0.152252197265625;0.13894144694010416;0.95703125;0.9453125;0.08978271484375;0.9588235294117647;31.07;12.6;12.3;15.1;14.9;15.6

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1915;247;"

**Decision Rule:**  
The access is granted if, for every element in the prohibition's domain, there exists a supporting element in the permission's domain that is strictly preferred to it.  

**Outcome:**  
Access is granted for Samuel_EvANS to perform the handle_db activity on sample_1.  

**Relations and Preferences:**  
1. **Role Preferences:**  
   - The role ""nurse"" in the east_hospital is preferred to ""student"" in the north_hospital.  
   - The job title ""liberal_doctor"" in the south_hospital is also preferred to ""student"".  
   - The specialized role ""specialist"" in north_hospital is preferred over ""student"".  

2. **Context Preferences:**  
   The context ""intern_presc_hour"" is preferred to ""sample_analysis"" in all three hospitals.  

3. **Other Considerations:**  
   The other elements, such as the handling of handle_db and the use of sample_1, are identical in both the permission and prohibition supports, so no additional preference checks are needed.  

**Conclusion:**  
All required conditions are met due to the role and context preferences, leading to the access being granted.";0.8123372395833333;0.6339111328125;0.5833536783854166;0.98876953125;0.91845703125;0.06280517578125;0.9276315789473684;37.71;12.1;13.62;13.9;14.9;15.5

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if, according to the given logic, for each element of the prohibition support, there is a corresponding element of the permission support where each element of the permutation is strictly preferred to its corresponding element in the prohibition support.

**Outcome:**  
The decision outcome is that access is granted because each element of the forbidden support is dominated by the corresponding element of the permitted support.

**Relations and Preferences:**  
1. **Role Preferences:**  
   - The role ""nurse"" in the west_hospital is preferred to the role ""patient"" in the same hospital.  
   - The roles ""hospital_doctor"" and ""surgeon"", along with their respective contexts, are preferred to ""patient"", ""extern"", and ""afternoon"".  

2. **Context Preferences:**  
   All contexts related to ""anesthetic_patient"" are preferred to contexts like ""no_anesthesia"", ""afternoon"", etc., ensuring dominance in each case.  

3. **Other Elements:**  
   Shared elements such as ""consideration of prescribe_appointment"" and ""use of patinet_admin_data"" do not require preference checks as they are identical in both supports.

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if for every Prohibition's support, there exists a Permission's support where each element is strictly preferred.

**Outcome:**  
The access is granted because each Prohibition's support is dominated by a corresponding Permission's support.

**Details:**  
1. **Proihilation 1 (West Hospital):**  
   - **Role Preferred:** Nurse (north_hospital) over Patient (west_hospital).  
   - **Context Preferred:** Emergency over afternoon.

        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";2322;283;"

**Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for every support in the prohibition (forbiddance), there exists a corresponding supporting element in the permission (permutation) where each element of the permutation is strictly preferable to the corresponding element of the prohibition.

**Outcome**: Access is denied.

**Reasoning**:

1. **Analysis of Supports and Preferences**:
   - **Permutation (Permission)**: Multiple supports exist, including roles like 'intern', 'surgeon', 'anesthetist', etc., each with specific contexts.
   - **Prohibition (Forbiddance)**: Only one support exists, involving the role 'student', context 'morning', and a specific activity.

2. **Comparison of Supports**:
   - The 'student' role in the prohibition is less preferable than 'intern' in the permutation.
   - The context 'morning' in the prohibition is the same as in the permutation, not strictly preferable.

3. **Dominance Check**:
   - For the prohibition's 'student' role, the permutation's 'intern' role is preferable, but the context does not meet the strict preference requirement.
   - Without a permutation support where all elements (role and context) are strictly preferable to the prohibition's, access is denied.

Thus, the absence of a fully dominating permutation support for the prohibition's single support results in access denial.";0.358424072265625;0.070709228515625;0.0552734375;0.2354736328125;0.9765625;0.5458984375;0.9672131147540983;19.67;14.9;13.41;16.0;16.01;17.5

        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";2477;249;"

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if, according to the given logic, for each support in a prohibition, there's at least one corresponding support in the permission such that each element in that permutation is strictly preferred to its corresponding element in the prohibits' support.

**Outcome:**  
The access is granted because all elements of the permutation's support are strictly preferred to the corresponding elements of the prohibition's supports.

**Relations and Preferences:**  
1. **Role Preferences:**  
   - The role ""nurse"" in the north_hospital is preferred to ""student"" in the south_hospital, west_hospital, etc.
   - Similarly, ""doctor"" and ""anesthetist"" are preferred roles over ""student"" in various contexts.

2. **Context Preferences:**  
   Specific contexts like ""anesthesic_patient"" and ""emergency"" are preferred over ""no_anesthesia"" and ""sample_analysis"".

3. **Activity and View Preferences:**  
   The activity ""prescribe"" and view ""personal_data"" or ""prescribtion_data"" are consistent across supports, indicating no preference change in these areas.

All these preferences ensure that the permutation supports dominate the prohibition supports, satisfying the access grant condition.";0.5584177652994791;0.54498291015625;0.3061879475911458;0.244384765625;0.9462890625;0.249755859375;0.930379746835443;17.84;15.6;16.77;16.8;18.16;19.5

Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";2812;336;"

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if, within each support of a prohibits, there exists a dominant support in the permission. Dominance is established when each element in the permission’s support is strictly preferred compared to the corresponding element in the prohibition’s support.

**Outcome:**  
The access is granted for Charlie_Brown due to the dominance conditions being fulfilled.

**Relations and Preferences:**

1. **Role Comparisons:**
   - **Hospital Doctor vs. Extern:**  
     The role ""hospital.doctor"" in east.hospital is preferred over the role ""extern"" in other hospitals because hospital.doctor is a higher position.
   - **Liberal Doctor vs. Exter:**  
     The roles ""liberal.doctor"" in north.hospital and west.hospital are preferred over ""extern.""
   - **Other Roles:**  
     Other roles like ""student"" do not influence the decision as they are not present in the prohibitions.

2. **Prohibition Contexts:**
   - The contexts ""anesthetist"" and ""referent_doctor"" in various hospitals are preferred over the context ""no_anesthesia.""
   - The context ""sample_analysis"" is preferred over ""morning.""

3. **Handling Activity and View Elements:**
   - Both ""handle"" and ""view"" activities are consistent across the supports, so no additional preferences are needed.
   - The views ""medical_data"" and ""personal_data"" are handled similarly in their respective contexts.

**Conclusion:**  
All elements of the permission’s support are either strictly preferred or identical to the corresponding elements in the prohibited support. Hence, access is granted.";0.44325103759765627;0.195526123046875;0.15988922119140625;0.78125;0.8681640625;0.78857421875;0.9047619047619048;27.79;11.8;11.17;12.2;15.46;13.8

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1675;299;"

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if, for each prohibition support, there exists a permission support where each element of the permutation support is strictly preferred compared to the corresponding element in the prohibition support.

**Outcome:**  
The access is granted because both prohibition supports are dominated by their corresponding permission supports.

**Relations and Preferences:**  
1. **Role Preference:**  
   - The role ""liberal_doctor"" in the permission is preferred over ""patient"" in the prohibition.  
   - This preference is consistent across both contexts (emergency and morning).

2. **Context Preference:**  
   -(a) The context ""emergency"" in the first permission support is preferred over ""no_anesthesia"" in the first prohibition support.  
   -(b) The context ""em er sity"" in the second permission support is pre ferred over ""morning"" in the second prohibition support.

3. **Other Elements:**  
   - Both permission and prohibition supports share the following elements:  
     - ""The organisation north hospital considers cancer_analysis as an analyze activity.""  
     - ""Sample_5 is used in the view.""  
   - These elements are identical in both supports, so no additional preference is needed.

**Conclusion:**  
Since all elements of the permutation support are either strictly preferred or identical to the corresponding elements in the prohibited support, the access for ""Katherine_Moore"" to perform ""cancer_analysis"" on ""sample_5"" is granted.";0.755242919921875;0.451812744140625;0.451812744140625;0.9716796875;0.94677734375;0.045867919921875;0.9353233830845771;28.13;13.7;12.21;15.5;16.35;17.1

**Outcome:**  
The access is granted because for each support of the prohibition, a corresponding support of the permission exists where the elements of the permission are strictly preferred to those of the prohibition.

**Relations and Preferences:**  
1. **Role Preferences:**  
   - The role ""doctor"" is strictly preferred to ""medical_secretary"".  
   - The context ""emergency"" is considered strictly preferred to ""sample_analysis"".  

2. **Context Preferences:**  
   All contexts in the permission supports (""emergency"" and ""sample_analysis"") are evaluated, with ""emergency"" being the most preferred.  

3. **Element Comparisons:**  
   - Each element in the permission's supports is checked against the corresponding elements in each prohibition's supports.  
   - For example, the role ""doctor"" in a permission support is compared to the role ""medical secretary"" in a prohibition support, showing strict preference.  

4. **Dominance Conditions:**  
   - All elements in the permission's support meet the dominance criteria over the corresponding elements in any given prohibition's support.  

**Conclusion:**  
Based on the above analysis, the access for Eva_Clark performing the activity ""aOperate"" on ""patinet_admin_date_1"" is granted due to the dominance of the permission's elements over the prohibition's elements.";0.6553795708550347;0.3138580322265625;0.1932644314236111;0.9453125;0.9501953125;0.125732421875;0.9545454545454546;15.81;16.4;14.93;17.6;16.82;19.1

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";3245;1798;"The detailed step-by-step explanation of the decision-making process, including the reasoning behind each part of the explanation. 

Okay, so I need to figure out why access was granted based on the given logic and the supports provided. Let me start by understanding the overall logic first.

The main rule is that access is granted if, for each element in the prohibition support, there's a corresponding element in the permission support where the permission's element is strictly preferred to the prohibition's. So, it's like a one-to-one comparison between the two sets of supports.

Looking at the input, there are two parts: the supports of permission and the supports of prohibition. Each support has several elements. For each support in the prohibition, I need to find a matching support in the permission where each element in the permission is preferred to the corresponding element in the prohibition.

Starting with the first support in the prohibition. It's about the role 'extern' in north_hospital granting the Prohibition to operate on medical_file with morning context. So, I need to check if there's a corresponding support in the permission. Looking at the permissions, there's a support where the role is 'doctor' in east_hospital with the same context. Since doctor is preferred over extern, this seems to satisfy the condition.

Next, the second support in the prohibition is about the role 'student' in northern_hospital with no_anesthesia context. Checking the permissions, there’s a 'student' role in north_hospital, but that's the same as the prohibition, so maybe it's not a match. Wait, no, the permission has 'student' in north_hospitals? Or is it elsewhere? Wait, looking back, the permissions have 'doctor', 'surgeon', 'medical_secretary', and 'student' in east and north hospitals. Hmm, perhaps I need to match each prohibition support with a permission support.

Wait, maybe each support in the prohibitions needs to be matched with a permission support. So, for each support in the prohibited activities, find a corresponding support in permission where each element is preferred.

So, for the first support in prohibition: north_hospital, role 'extern', context 'morning'. In the permissions, east_hospital has 'doctor' role with 'morning' context. Since doctor > extern, this is a match.

Second support in prohibition is north_hospital, 'student' role, 'no_anesthesia' context. Looking for a permission support where the role in permission is preferred over 'student'. East_hospital has 'student' as a role, but that's same as the prohibition. North_hospital also has 'student' role. Maybe it's a match, but since it's the same, perhaps it doesn't satisfy the strict preference. So maybe this doesn't apply.

Wait, but the preference is about the entire support, not just the role. Each element in the permission's support must be strictly preferred to the corresponding in the prohibition. So, perhaps the 'student' in the permission is not preferred over 'student' in prohibition, so this might not satisfy the condition.

Similarly, for the third support in prohibition: east_hospital, 'medical_secretary' role, 'sample_analysis' context. The permission has 'medical_secretary'' in east_hospital, so same as prohibition. Again, same role, so no preference.

Fourth support: north_hospital's 'student' role with 'no_anesthesia'. Same as before, no preference.

Fifth support: east_hospital's 'medical_secondary' role with 'sample_analysis'—wait, maybe a typo? It says 'medical_secretary'. Anyway, the role is same as in the prohibition, so no preference again.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Each support in the prohibition has multiple elements: role, employes, considers activity, uses view, and context. For each of these, I need to see if the permission's corresponding elements are preferred.

But the dominance is per support, not per element. So, each entire support in the prohibition must have a corresponding support in permutation where each element in permutation is preferred to the prohibition.

So, for each support S in prohibition, find a support P in permission where for each element in P, it's preferred to the corresponding S.

So, let's go through each support in prohibition:

1. North_hospital, role=extern, activity=operate, view=medical_file, context=morning.

Looking for a permission support that includes role=doctor (since doctor > extern), activity=operate (same), view=medical_file (same), context=morning (same). So, the east_hospital's support where role=doctor, employes=James_Wilson, considers aOperate, uses admin_data in view admin_data, and context=intern_presc_hour. Wait, but the context here is intern_presc_hour, which is preferred over morning. So, the context in the permission is better than the prohibition's. But the other elements are same. So, does this count as a match? Because the context is preferred, but the other elements are the same. So, the entire support in the permission is dominated because the context is better, but the others are same.

Wait, but dominance requires that each element in the permutation is strictly preferred to S's. So, if any element is same, then it's not strictly preferred. So, in this case, since the role, activity, and view are same, but the context is better in the permission, does that mean the permutation's context is preferred to the S's? No, because the S's context is morning, and the permutation's is intern_presc_hour, which is better. So, in terms of preference, intern_presc_hower is preferred to morning, so the permutation's context element is preferred to S's.

So, for this support, the permutation's support has the same role, same activity, same view, but a better context. So, does that count as a dominance? Because each element of the permutation's support is either same or preferred. But dominance requires each element to be strictly preferred. Since some elements are same (role, activity, view), it doesn't satisfy dominance. So, this support in the prohibition doesn't have a corresponding permutation support where all elements are strictly preferred.

Wait, but perhaps the entire support is considered as a whole. So, the permutation's entire support (role, employes, activity, view, context) is compared to the S's support. So, if the permutation's support as a whole is strictly preferred, then it's a match.

But the dominance condition is that each element is strictly preferred, not the entire support. So, even if the entire support is better, if any element isn't strictly preferred, it doesn't meet the condition.

So, in the first support of the prohibition, the permutation's role is doctor, which is preferred to extern, but the context in the permutation is better (intern_presc_hour > morning). However, the other elements (activity, view) are same as the S's. Since some elements aren't strictly preferred, the condition isn't met. So, this would mean that the first support in prohibits doesn't have a matching support in permutation, so access shouldn't be granted.

But wait, in the given decision, access was granted. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the dominance is checked across all elements, not per element in the same position. So, for example, the role in the permutation is doctor, and the role in S is extern. So, doctor > extern. The activity is same. The view is same. The context in permutation is better (higher preference). So, overall, the permutation's elements are all at least as good as S's, and at least one is strictly better. So, that would satisfy the dominance condition.

Wait, but according to the given decision, the access is granted. So, maybe my initial analysis was wrong.

Let me think again. The decision rule is that for each support in prohibition, there's a supporting support in permission where the permutation's elements dominate the S's. So domination is when each element in permutation's support is at least as preferred as S's, with at least one being strictly preferred.

So, if for each S in prohibited, there's a P in permitted where P's elements are >= S's, with >= in at least one element, and > in at least one, then access is granted.

Wait, no, the rule is that each element in P is strictly preferred to corresponding in S. So, each element in P must be > than in S.

So, for all elements in P's support, they must be > than S's. So if any element in P is";0.417266845703125;0.2525177001953125;0.2243194580078125;0.1978759765625;0.8798828125;0.46826171875;0.9808282208588956;49.41;9.7;7.52;12.2;12.0;11.0

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.
