**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

To determine why access was granted, we follow these steps:

1. **Identify Permissions and Prohibitions:**
   - **Permissions:** These are the rights granted, such as modifying contracts, administrative activities, internal data, reports, and specific roles like wp_leader and coordinator.
   - **Prohibitions:** These are the restrictions, such as prohibiting modifications on reports, administrative activities, and internal data.

2. **Understand Dominance:**
   - For each permission support, there must be a corresponding prohibition support where every element in the permission's support is strictly preferred over the prohibition's.

3. **Compare Supports:**
   - Each permission support is compared against each prohibition support to check for dominance.

4. **Check Preferences:**
   - Preferences between roles and contexts (like wp_leader over post_doc, secondment over collaboration) are considered.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - If all permissions' supports dominate their respective prohibptions, access is granted.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

- **Permission Supports:**
  1. **wp_leader (University1):**
     - Modifies contracts using dataset8 during secondment.
     - Dominates the first prohibition (post_doc) because wp_leader > post_doc and secondment > collaboration.

  2. **Coordinators (Institute3 and others):**
     - Audit, secondment, etc., each dominating specific prohibitions based on role and context preferences.

- **Prohibition Supports:**
  - Each is dominated by the corresponding permission support due to role and context dominance.

**Final Outcome:**

Access is granted because each permission's support (e.g., wp_leader, coordinators) dominates the corresponding prohibition, ensuring that the necessary conditions for editing dataset8 are met.";0.52073486328125;0.21832275390625;0.182958984375;0.62109375;0.93701171875;0.355712890625;0.9601769911504425;14.86;14.7;13.56;15.6;20.35;19.8

**Step-by-String Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Decision Rule:**
   - Access is granted if each permission's support dominantly corresponds to a prohibition's support. Dominance is determined by strict preference in roles and contexts.

2. **Outcome:**
   - The access was granted because each permission support dominantly corresponds with a prohibition support, meeting the required conditions.

3. **Details on Relations and Preferences:**
   1. **Role Preferences:**
      - wp_leader is preferred above post_doc.
      - Coordinator is preferred above both post_doc and staff_member.
      - Secondment is preferred above collaboration.
      - Audit is preferred above default.
      - Management is preferred above collaboration.

   2. **Context Preferences:**
      Contexts like secondment, audit, and management are preferred over collaboration, default, and others.

   3. **Specific Permutations:**
      - **Permutation 1:** wp_leader in University1's secondment context dominates the post_doc prohibition in the same context.
      - **Permutations 2-5:** Coordinators in various contexts (audit, secondment, default, management) each dominate their respective prohibitions within those contexts.

**Conclusion:**
The edit on dataset8 was permitted because the wp_leader role in University1's context of secondment satisfies the dominance condition over the corresponding prohibition.";0.724146728515625;0.786376953125;0.646612548828125;0.73095703125;0.9482421875;0.491455078125;0.9418604651162791;17.4;13.7;13.23;14.1;19.7;18.1

**Explanation:**

1. **The decision rule is:**
   Access is granted when, for every support in the prohibition list, there's a matching support in the permission list where each element in the permission support is strictly preferred over the corresponding element in its respective prohibition support.

2. **The outcome is:**
   The permission forFrank_Harry to perform the activity 'ask' on the view 'dataset3' has been granted.

3. **The relations and preferences that led to the decision:**
   a. **Role Preference:** The employment of Frank_Harris as a 'team_leader' is preferred over him being a 'secondee.' This is because 'team_leader' has a higher preference value than 'secondee.'
   b. **Context Preference:** The scenario where the 'context secondment' holds is preferred over the 'context default.' This preference is due to 'secondment' being ranked higher than 'default' in terms of desirability.
   c. **View Preference:** The 'dataset3' in the view 'contracts' is preferred over 'WP1' in the same view, reflecting a higher preference for 'contracts' over 'WP1.'
   d. **Activity Preference:** The activity 'consult' on the 'view contracts' is preferred over the same activity on 'WP1,' indicating a preference for 'contracts.'

These elements together satisfy the dominance condition required for granting access.";0.9355712890625;0.882080078125;0.882080078125;0.982421875;0.9658203125;0.0345458984375;0.9895287958115183;43.63;11.9;12.67;14.7;13.69;15.7

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.";1379;436;"

**1. Decision Rule:**  
The access is granted if, for each support of prohibited activities, there exists a supporting element in the permission's support that dominates it. Domination occurs when each element of a permutation's support is more preferred than at least one element from the corresponding prohibition's support.

**2. Outcome:**  
Rachel_Baker is granted access to perform the ""move"" action on ""report6"". This is because each support in the prohibitions is matched with a corresponding support in permissions where the permutation elements dominate the prohibitions.

**3. Relations and Preferences:**  
- **Permutation Supports vs. Prohibitions:**  
  - Each permutation support (e.g., ""wp_leader"", ""coordinator"", ""researcher"") corresponds to a prohibition support (e.g.,
    ""staff_member"", ""PhD_student"", ""researcher"").  
  - The roles are preferred in the order: wp_leader > coordinator > researcher > PhD_student > staff_member.  
  - The contexts (like ""context audit"", ""context management"", ""context collaboration"") are preferred as audit > management > collaboration.  

- **Dominance Examples:**  
  - ""wp_leader"" in permutations dominates ""staff_member"" in prohibitions.  
  - ""coordinator"" dominates ""staff_member"".  
  - ""researcher"" dominates both ""PhD_student"" and ""staff_member"".  

- **Context Dominance:**  
  - Contexts like ""context audit"" and ""context management"" dominate ""context collaboration"" in all cases.  

- **Role and Context Interactions:**  
  - In each organization (Institute3, University3, Institute2), the specific roles and contexts align to satisfy the dominance conditions.  
  - For example, in Institute3, ""wp_leader"" role with ""context audit"" supports the move on ""view deliverables"".  

- **Final Match:**  
  - The highest preferred role (""researcher"") with the highest preferred context (""context management"") ensures the move on ""report6"" is allowed.  

Thus, all conditions are met, and Rachel_Baker's access is granted.";0.5426839192708333;0.15618896484375;0.13120524088541666;0.97509765625;0.880859375;0.429931640625;0.953125;24.34;13.1;11.71;14.2;18.55;18.4

**1. Decision Rules:**  
The access control is determined based on the dominance of permutation supports over prohibition supports. A support of a permission dominates a support of a prohibition if each element in the permutation's support is strictly preferred to the corresponding element in the prohibition's support.  

**2. Outcomes:**  
Access is granted to Rachel_Baker to execute the ""move"" activity on ""report6"".

**3. Relationships & Preferences:**

- **Roles and Their Preferences:**  
  The roles are prioritized as follows:  
  researcher > coordinator >wp_leader > PhD_Student > staff_member.

- **Contexts and Their Preferences:**   
  The contexts are ordered as:  
  context_audit > context_management > context_collaboration.

- **Action-Specific Permissibility:**  
  Each action (e.g., modify on deliverables) is permitted under specific roles and contexts. For instance, the ""move"" can be performed by ""researcher"" when the context is ""context_management"".

- **Conditions Met for ""move"" on ""report6"":**  
  - The role is ""researcher"", which is the highest preferred role.  
  - Context is ""context_management"", the highest preferred context.  
  - These meet the dominance criteria, allowing the move on report six.

**1. Decision Rule:**  
The access is granted if the highest preferred permission support dominates the highest preferred prohibition support.

**2. Outcome:**  
Rachel_Baker is granted permission to perform the ""modify"" action on ""deliverables.""

**3. Relationships and Preferences:**  

- **Role and Context Preferences:**  
  Roles are prioritized as: researcher > coordi-nator > wp_leader > phd_student > staff_member.  
  Contexts are ordered: context_audit > context manage-ment > context collaboration.

- **Action Requirements:**  
  The ""modify"" action is allowed for ""deliverables"" when assigned to a ""researcher"" in a ""context_management"" setting.

- **Dominance Analysis:**  
  The highest preferred permission (""researcher"" in ""context_management"") dominantes the highest preferred prohibition (""staff_member"" in ""context_collolution""). This is because ""researcher"" > ""staff_member"" and ""context_management"" > ""context_collaboration.""

**1. DecisionRule:** The access is granted based on the dominance of the highest preferred permission over the highest preferred prohibition. Dominance is determined by the strict preference of each element in the permission's support over at least one element in the prohibition's support, considering both roles and contexts.

**2. Outcomes:** Rachel_Baker has been granted the permission to perform the modify action on report6.

**3. Relationships:**

- **Role Preferences (from highest to lowest):**
  - Researcher
  - Coordinator
  - wp_leader
  - PhD_student
  - staff_member

- **Context Preferences (from highest priority to lowest):**
    - context_audit
    - context_management
    - context_collaboration

- **Action Rules:**
  - The modify action on deliverables is permitted when assigned to a researcher within a context_management setting.
  - This action is forbidden for staff members in a context_collaboration setting.

- **Key Relationships Influencing the Decision:**
  - **Role and Context Dominance:**
    - The highest permitted role is researcher, and the highest allowed context is context_management.
    - The highest prohibited role is staff_member, and the highest prohibited context is context_collaboration.
  - **Strict Preference in Roles:**
    - Researcher > Coordinator
    - Coordinator > wp_leader
    - wp_leader > PhDStudent
    - PhDStudent > staff_member
  - **Strict Preferability in Contexts:**
    - context_management >(context_audit, context_collaboration)
    - context_audit and context_collaboration are incomparable.

- **Why the Access WasGranted:**
  - Highest Preferred Permission (researcher, context_management) completely dominates the Highest Preferred Prohibition (staff_member, context_collaborATION).
  - Dominance is confirmed by the strict preference in both role and context.
  - Thus, the access was granted due to the dominance of the permitted conditions over the prohibited ones.";0.5306416829427083;0.189483642578125;0.16636149088541666;0.9814453125;0.8212890625;0.50537109375;0.9407114624505929;0.42;18.2;14.0;17.3;22.22;23.3

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.";775;1801;"1. **DecisionRule**: The access is granted if for each support of the prohibition, there exists an element in the support of the permutation where the permutation's element is strictly preferred to the prohibition's element. 

Wait, actually, I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that. The access is granted when for each support in the prohibition, there's a corresponding support in the permission where each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to some element in the prohibition's support. So, it's not just one element, but for each element in the permission's support, it's strictly preferred to some in the prohibition's.

Wait, no, the dominance is that each element of the permutation's support is strictly better than at least one element in the prohibition’s support. So, for each p in perm_support, there exists a c in prohibition_support such that p > c.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the dominance definition. The dominance is that each permutation's support element is strictly preferred over at least one in the prohibition's. So, for all p in perm_support and for all c in prohibition_support, p > c? No, that can't be. It must be that for each p, there's at least one c where p > c. So, for every p in perm, there exists c in prohibition where p > c.

So, the condition is that for each p in the permutation's support, there exists at least one c in the prohibition's such that p is strictly preferred to c.

Therefore, the decision rule is: Access is granted if, for every support in the prohibition list, there exists a support in the permission list where each element of permutation support is strictly preferred over some element in the corresponding prohibition support.

Wait, perhaps more accurately: For each support S_p in the prohibited supports, there must exist a support S_perm in the permitted supports such that for every element s_perm in S_perm, there exists an s_p in S_p where s_perm is strictly preferred to s_p.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me refer back to the initial problem statement.

The condition is: For each support of a forbidden (prohibition), there exists a corresponding supporting support for a permission, where the permutation's support dominates the forbidden's.

Dominance is: Each element of the permutation support is strictly dominated by at least one element from the forbidden's support. Wait, no, dominance is that each p in permutation's support is dominated by some c in the forbidden's support, meaning p < c? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the problem says: ""Dominance means that each element of permutation's support is *strictly preferred* to at least one of the elements of the prohibition's support.""

So, if p is in permutation's support and c is in prohibition's support, then p > c.

Thus, for each p ∈ perm_support, ∃ c ∈ prohibition_support such that c < p.

So, the dominance condition is satisfied if for every p in permutation support, there's a c in prohibition support where c is less preferred than p.

Therefore, the overall condition is: For every support S_p in prohibitions, there exists a permutation support S_perm such that for every p in S_perm, exists c in S_p where p > c (i.e., p is strictly preferred over c).

Now, looking at the given data:

Permitted Supports (S_perm):

1. (researcher, audit, report7, select)

2. (post_doc, collaboration, report7, context)

3. (secondee, collaboration, contracts, select)

Prohibited Supports (S_p):

1. (Chloe_Walker, researcher, select, report7) with context audit

2. (Chloe Walker, post_doc, select, contracts) with context collaboration

3. (ChloeWalker, secondee, contracts, select) with context collaboration.

Wait, perhaps the supports are as follows:

Permitted Supports:

1. Researcher, Audit, Report7, Select

2. Post_doc, Collaboration, Report7, Context

3. Secondee, Collaboration, Contracts, Select

Prohibited Supports:

1. Institute3: (Chloe Walker as researcher, context audit)

2. Institute2: (Post_doc, context collaboration)

3. Institute2: Secondee, context collaboration.

But perhaps I need to look at each support and their elements.

Wait, the user provided the supports as follows:

For Permitted:

- Support 1: (researcher; audit; report7; select)

- Support 2: (post_doc; collaboration; report7; context)

- Support 3: (secondee; collaboration; contracts; select)

For Prohibited:

Support 1: (Institute3: researcher; context audit; select; report7)

Support 2: (Institute2: post_doc; context collaboration; select; contracts)

Support 3: same as 2 but for secondee.

Wait, perhaps each support is a tuple of elements, and for each support in prohibited, we need to find a corresponding support in permitted where each element is strictly preferred.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each support as a set of roles and contexts.

But perhaps the key is that for each prohibited support, there must be a permitted support where each element in the permitted is strictly preferred to its corresponding element in the prohibited.

Wait, maybe the dominance is across the entire support, not per element. So, for a given prohibited support S_p, there exists a permitted support S_perm where each element in S_perm is strictly preferred over the corresponding element in S_p.

Wait, that might make more sense. So, for example, if S_p is (A, B, C), then S_perm must be (A', B', C') where A' > A, B' > B, C' > C.

But in the given data, the supports are:

Permitted:

1. researcher, audit, report_7, select

2. post_doc, collaboration,report7,context

3. secondee,collaboration,contracts,select

Prohibited:

1. (Institute3's researcher, context audit, select,report7)

2. (Institute2's post_doc, context collaboration,select,contracts)

3. (InstituteI2's secondee, same context collaboration, contracts,select)

Wait, perhaps the 'context' is part of the support.

So, for each prohibited support (which includes the context), we need a permitted support where the entire tuple is such that each element is strictly better than the prohibited's.

Wait, but the dominance is per element, not per tuple.

Wait, the problem states that dominance is when each element of the permit support is strictly preferred compared to the prohibition's.

So, for example, for a prohibited support S_p = (a, b, c, d), we need a permutation support S = (a', b', c', d') such that a' > a, b' > b, c' > c, d' > d.

But looking at the data:

Permitted supports:

1. researcher (R), audit (A), report7 (R7), select (S)

2. post_doc (P), collaboration (C), R7, context (X)

3. seconder (Se), C, contracts (Co), S

Prohibited supports:

1. (I3, R, S, R7, A) - Wait, perhaps each prohibited support is a tuple including the organization, role, context, etc.

Wait, the prohibited supports are:

Support 1:

- Institute3 grants to researcher the permission to consult on public_data with context audit.

So, the prohibited support would be (I3, researcher, context=audit, consult, public_data).

Similarly, support 2:

- Institute2 grants post_doc to perform consult on confidential_data with context collaboration.

So, prohibited support is (I2, post_doc, context=collaboration, consult, confidential_data).

Support 3:

- InstituteI2 grants secondee to consult on contracts with context collaboration.

Thus, another prohibited support: (I2, seconder, collaboration, consult, contracts).

Now, the permitted supports are:

1. InstituteI3: researcher, audit, R7, select.

2. I2: post_doc, collaboration,R7,context.

3. I2: seconder, collab, contracts, select.

Wait, but how do these relate to the prohibited supports?

Wait, perhaps the permitted supports are the ones that are allowed, and the prohibited supports are the ones disallowed.

2. Outcome Details:
   - Preferred Hierarchy:
     - Roles ranked from highest to lowest: researcher, post_doc, secondee.
     - Context types ordered: audit > collaboration.
     - Consultation types ordered: select > contracts.
   - Dominance Analysis:
     - Institute3's support (researcher, audit, select, report7) strictly dominates Institute2's (post_doc, collaboration, select, contracts).
     - Therefore, the permission is granted.

3. Conditions Met:
   - The dominance condition is satisfied because researcher and audit are higher than post_doc and collaboration, respectively.

4. Conclusion:
   - The access is granted to Chloe_Walker for performing select on report7.

But the user says the first answer didn't cover well, specifically the decision outcome was incorrect. So I need to adjust the explanation to correctly reflect the decision outcome based on the provided logic.

Alright, let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the overall logic provided. The access is granted if for every support in a prohibition, there is a corresponding support in a permission where each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to those in the prohibition's support.

Looking at the supports:

For Permissions (Allowances):
1. Institute3 allows researcher to consult on public_data with context audit.
2. Institute3 allows secondee to consult on contracts with context audit.

For Prohibitions:
1. Institute2 prohibits post_doc from consulting on confidential_data with context collaboration.
2. Institute2 prohibits secondee from consulting on contracts with context collaboration.

Now, the preferences are structured as:
- Roles: Researcher > Post_doc > Secondee
- Context Types: Audit > Collaboration
- Consultation Types: Select > Contracts

So, the key is to check if each prohibition's support is dominated by a permission's support.

Let's take the first Prohibition (Institute2, post_doc, collaboration, etc.). The corresponding Permission would be Institute3's researcher support because researcher is higher in the role hierarchy. Also, the context audit is higher than collaboration, so the audit context dominates the collaboration context.

Similarly, the second Prohibition (Institutes2, secondee, collaboration, etc.) is dominated by Institute3's secondee? Wait, no. Wait, the permissions for secondee are in Institute3, but the prohibition is also for secondee in Institute2. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the supports.

Wait, the permissions have two supports: one for researcher and one for secondee, both in Institute3. The prohibitions have two supports: post_doc and secondee, in Institute2.

So, for each Prohibition support, we need to find a Permission support that dominates it.

Prohibition 1: Institute2, post_doc role, collaboration context. The corresponding Permission support would be Institute3, researcher role, audit context. Since researcher > post_doc and audit > collaboration, this support in Institute3 dominates the Prohibition's support in Institute2. So, the Prohibition is dominated by the Permission.

Prohibition 2: Institute2's secondee role with collaboration context. Looking at the permissions, there's a secondee role in Institute3 with audit context. Since secondee < researcher but audit > collaboration, the secondee's context is dominated by audit, but the role is lower. However, the dominance requires each element of the Permission's support to be strictly preferred to the Prohibition's. Here, the seconder in Institute3 is lower than secondee in the hierarchy, but the context is higher. So, does the seconder's context (audit) dominate the seconder’s collaboration? Yes, because audit > collaboration. But the role is seconder, which is lower than itself? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps each support in the Prohibition must be dominated by a corresponding support in the Permission. So, for each element in the Prohibition, there must be a corresponding element in the Permission that is strictly preferred.

So, for Prohibition 2: In Institute2, seconder, collaboration, etc. The corresponding Permission is in Institute3, seconder with audit. But since seconder is the same role, just the context is audit instead of collaboration. So, the audit context is preferred over collaboration, so the context is dominated. But the role remains the same, so it's not strictly preferred. Hmm, that might not satisfy the dominance because the role is the same, not strictly preferred.

Wait, but the dominance is about each element of the permutation being strictly preferred. So, if the roles are the same, that's not strictly preferred; it's equal. So, perhaps the second Prohibition is not dominated by the second Permission because the role is not strictly preferred.

Alternatively, maybe the second Prohibition can be dominated by the first Permission (Institute3, researcher, audit). But the Prohibition is for seconder, not researcher. So, that might not apply.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

Each Prohibition's support must be dominated by some Permission's support. So for each Prohibition, there exists a Permission where each element in the Permission's support is strictly more preferred than the corresponding in the Prohibition.

Looking at Prohibition 1: It's for post_doc in Institute2, with collaboration context. The Permission for researcher in Institute3 has a higher role (researcher > post_doc) and a higher context (audit > collaboration). So, this Prohibition's support is dominated.

Proihilation 2: It's for seconder in institute2, with collaboration. The Permission for seconder is in institute3, with audit. Since audit > collaboration, but the roles are both seconder, so the role isn't strictly preferred. Therefore, this Prohibition may not be dominated by the corresponding Permission.

Wait, but maybe the seconder support in Institute3 is considered as a separate support. So, perhaps each Prohibition has two supports, and each needs to be matched with a Permission's support.

Wait, the problem states that for each support of the prohibition, there's a matching support in the permission. So, for the two Prohibition supports, each must have a corresponding Permission support that dominates.

So, Prohibition 1 is dominated by Permission 1 (Institute3 researcher, audit). Proihilation 2 is dominated by Permission2 (Institute3 seconder, audit). Wait, but the seconder is lower than post_doc and researcher, but in the Proihilation 2, the role is seco, and the corresponding Permission is seconder as well. So, the role is same, not strictly better. Therefore, the dominance is not met for the second Prohibition.

Wait, that can't be right because the user says the access was granted. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Wait, perhaps the Permissions have two supports each, and the Prohibitions also have two, and each Prohibition support is matched to a Permission support.

So, for the first Prohibition support (Institute2's post_doc, collaboration), it's matched to Institute3's researcher, audit. That works because researcher > post_doc, and audit > collaboration.

For the second Proihilation (Institute2 seconder, collaborations), it's matched against Institute3 seconder's audit. But since the role is same (seconder), it's not strictly better, so the dominance isn't met. Therefore, the second Proihilation is not dominated, so access should be denied.

But the user said the access was granted, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the Permissions have multiple supports, and each Proihilation is matched to the best possible Permission support. Or perhaps the entire set of Proihilation supports must be dominated by the Permission's supports.

Alternatively, perhaps the decision is based on the highest priority Prohibition being dominated.

Wait, the user's initial answer was that the access is granted, but the user says it's incorrect. So, perhaps I need to re-examine.

Wait, the decision rule is that for each Prohibition's support, there exists a Corresponding Permission's support that dominates it. So, if any Proihilation support is not dominated by any Permission's support, then access is denied.

So, looking at the two Proihilation supports:

1. Institute2's Proihilation 1: post_doc, collaboration. It's dominated by Institute3 researcher, audit.

2. Institute2's";0.606884765625;0.6925048828125;0.6925048828125;0.70947265625;0.80126953125;0.861328125;0.9880478087649402;33.31;11.7;7.16;13.1;14.49;12.8

2. **Outcomes**:
   - Mia_anderson is granted permission to sign_on dataset8 due to the dominance of the permutation support over the prohibition support.

3. **Connections**:
   - **First Prohibition Support (Institute2)**: The permutation support (University1, Coordinator, Secondment) surpasses the prohibition support (Istitute2, Staff_member, Collaboration) in terms of preference.
   - **Second Prohibition Support (University3)**: Again, the permutation support from University1 surpasses University3's PhD_student in preference.

4. **Preferential Relationships**:
   - Coordinator is preferred over Staff_member.
   - Secondment is preferred over both Collaboration and PhD_student.

**Decision Rule:** Access is granted if, for each permission's support, there exists a prohibiting support where the permutation of roles and contexts in the permission are strictly preferred to those in the prohibition.

**Outcome:** James_Wilson's permission to sign on dataset_8 is granted.

**Preferences and Relations:**

1. **Role Preferences:**
   - **Researcher > Coordinator > Secondee:** Researcher is preferred over Coordinator, who is preferred over Secondee. This hierarchy ensures that higher responsibilities are considered more critical, aligning with the principle that researchers have more significant tasks than coordinators, who in turn outrank seconders.

2. **Context Preferences:**
   -(a) **Audit > Management > Default:** Audit contexts are preferred over Management contexts, which in turn are preferred over Default contexts. This hierarchy reflects the varying levels of access clearance, with audit being the highest, followed by management, and then default.

3. **Elementary Preferences:**
   ```plaintext
   - Dataset8 is consistently present in all relevant contexts, ensuring that the dominance is not affected by the specific dataset but rather by the role and context.
   ```

**Explanation:**

James_Wilson was given access to sign on _dataset8_ because:

- **Role Hierarchy:** His role as a _researcher_ is preferred over _coordinator_ and _secondee_, indicating a higher level of responsibility.
- **Context Hierarchy:** The _audit_ context he operates under is preferred over _management_ and _default_ contexts, reflecting a higher level of access clearance.
- **Consistency Across Supports:** The _dataset8_ is consistently referenced across all relevant supports, ensuring uniformity and reinforcing the dominance condition.

By satisfying the dominance condition across all relevant supports and preferences, James_Wil逊's access was granted.";0.5781348334418402;0.2337188720703125;0.2084689670138889;0.984375;0.94970703125;0.485595703125;0.9921568627450981;16.93;16.0;15.34;16.2;18.16;19.7

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted when, for each permission, a corresponding prohibition exists where the roles and/or contexts in the permission dominate those in the prohibition. Dominance is determined by strict preference in roles (researcher > coordinator > secondee) and contexts (audit > management > default).

**Outcome:**  
James_Wilson is granted access to sign documents on dataset8.

**Preferences and Relationships:**

1. Role Preferences:  
   - Researcher > Co ordinator > Secondee:  
     Researcher has the highest preference, followed by Coordinator, then Secondee.

2. Context Preferences:  
   Audit > Management > Default:  
     Audit contexts are preferred, followed by Management, then Default.

3. Specific Relationships:  
   - **Dataset8 Usage:**  
     Consistently appears in all relevant contexts (e.g., audit, management, default) across different roles (researcher, coordinator, secondee) in various organizations (University3, Institute3, Institute2, Institute1).

**Explanation of the Decision-Making Process:**

- **Role and Context Hierarchy:**  
  James_Wilson holds the role of researcher, which is higher than Coordinator and Secondee. The context used (audit) is preferred over Management and Default contexts.

- **Dominance Conditions:**  
  Each permission's role and context are strictly preferred over the corresponding prohibition. For example, the researcher role and audit context in University3's permission dominate the secondee role and default context in Institute2's prohibition.

- **Consistency in Dataset8:**  
  The dataset8 is consistently referenced in all relevant supports, reinforcing the dominance condition across different organizational structures.

By meeting these conditions, James_Wilso n is granted access to perform the required actions on dataset8.";0.8323540581597222;0.772216796875;0.7010769314236112;0.95361328125;0.89453125;0.15966796875;0.9482758620689655;13.34;15.3;13.0;15.7;20.12;19.4

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Decision Rule:**
   - Access is granted if each ""forbidden"" action (prohibition) has a corresponding ""permitted"" action (permission) where the permitted action's elements are strictly preferred to the forbidden ones.

2. **Identifying Key Supports:**
   - **Permitted Actions (Supports of Permissions):**
     - Researcher at Institute 3 can modify confidential data.
     - Team Leader at University 2 can modify secondment agreements.
     - Full Professor at University 2 has access to internal data.
   - **Forbidden Actions (Support of Prohibitions):**
     - PhD Student at Institute 1 can't modify data.
     - Post Doc at University 1 can't do the same.
     - Full Professors at Institute 1 have restricted access.
     - Team Leaders at Institute 1 also have restrictions.

3. **Evaluating Preferences:**
   - Researchers are preferred over other roles like PhD Students, Post Docs, and Full Professors.
   - Types of contexts (like Audit, Management, Collaboration, Secondment) have their own hierarchy, with Audit being the highest and Secondment the lowest.

4. **Checking Dominance:**
   - For each forbidden action, there's a permitted action where each element in the permitted action is preferred over the forbidden one.
   - Example: A PhD Student's context (Collaboration) is dominated by a Researcher's (Audit), ensuring access.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since all forbidden actions are dominated by higher-preference permitted actions, access is granted to Dylan_Nelson, allowing him to perform the necessary modifications.";0.4594207763671875;0.087493896484375;0.0733795166015625;0.69091796875;0.85986328125;0.41455078125;0.963963963963964;22.61;13.8;14.23;15.6;15.77;15.8

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Decision Rule:**
   - Access is granted if, for each support (prohibition), there's a corresponding support (permission) where the permission's elements (roles and contexts) are strictly preferred to the prohibition's.

2. **Identify Permissions and Prohibitions:**
   - **Permissions:**
     1. Researcher in Institute3: Modify confidential_data (context: audit)
     2. Team_leader in University2: Modify secondment_agreement (context: management)
     3. Full_Professor in University2: Internal_data (context: secondment)
   - **Prohibitions:**
     0. PhD_Student in Institute1: Data modification (context: collaboration)
     1. Post_DOC in University1: Data modification
     2. Move in University2: Data modification

3. **Match Permissions with Prohibitions:**

   a.) **PhD_Student Prohibition (Collaboration Context):**
      - Compare with Permissions:
        - Researcher (Institute3) has a higher preference (Researcher > PhD_Student) and their context (Audit) is higher than Collaboration.
      - **Conclusion:** PhD_Student's context is dominated, so access is granted.

   b.) **Post_DOC Prohibition (Collillation Context):**
      Similar to PhD_Student, Post_DOC is lower in preference, and their context is Collaboration, which is dominated.

   c.) **Move in University2 (Secondment Context):**
      Full_Professor has a higher role (Full_Professor > Post_DOC) and their context is Secondment, which is higher than Collaboration.

4. **Verify All Prohibitions Have Dominating Permissions:**
   - Each prohibition has a corresponding permission where elements are strictly preferred.

5. **Final Decision:**
   - Since all prohibitions are dominated by their respective permissions, access is granted for Dylan_Nelson's move on dataset3.

**Summary:**
By matching each prohibition with a higher-preference permission and ensuring dominance in both roles and contexts, access is granted.";0.48253173828125;0.67144775390625;0.5361328125;0.22802734375;0.85498046875;0.8779296875;0.9699570815450643;7.42;15.5;12.24;15.7;20.23;19.6

**1. Decision Rule**:  
The access is granted based on the following conditions:  
- For each support of a forbidden action (prohibition), there must exist a corresponding support for an allowed action (permission) where the permission's elements are strictly preferred to the prohibition's elements.  
- Dominance is defined as each element of the permutation's support being strictly preferred to at lease one element of the prohibitions' support.  

**2. Outcome**:  
Ben_Foster has been granted access to perform the action ""sign"" on the report ""report5"".  

**3. Relations and Preferences**:  
- **Permutation Supports**:  
  1. **Permutation Support 1**:  
     - The organization University1 allows Ben_Foster to be a full professor, enabling the action ""validate"" on the view ""WP2"".  
  2. **Permitation Support 2**:  
     - Similar to the first, University3 allows Ben_Foster as a team leader to perform ""validate"" on ""WP3"".  

- **Prohibitions Supports**:  
  - **Prohibition 1**: Institute3 prohibits Ben_Foster from performing ""validate"" on view ""WP5"" due to the role ""secondee"".  
  - **Case 2**: Institute3 also prohibits Ben_Foster acting as a ""staff_member"" to perform the same action on view ""WP3"".  
  - Case 3: University2 prohibits Ben_Foster, acting as a ""post_doc"", from performing ""validating"" on ""public_data"".  

- **Preferences**:  
  - The role ""full_professor"" in University1 is preferred over ""secondee"" in Institute3.  
  - ""Team_leader"" in University3 is preferred over ""staff_member"" in Institute3, and ""full_professor"".  
  - ""Post_doc"" in University2 is preferred over ""full_professor"", ""team_leader"", and ""secondee"".

- **Dominance Analysis**:  
  - Each element in the permutation supports (e.g., ""full_professor"") is strictly preferred to the corresponding elements in the prohibitions (e.g., roles in different organizations).  
  - This dominance satisfies the condition for access grant.  

**4. Analysis**:  
- The access is granted because for each prohibition (e.g., specific roles in different organizations), there exists a corresponding permission (e.g., higher-ranking roles in other organizations) where the elements of the permission's support are strictly preferred to those of the prohibition's support.  
- This ensures that Ben_Foster can perform the required action without violating any prohibitions.";0.6941426595052084;0.5221761067708334;0.4365743001302083;0.8583984375;0.9677734375;0.314208984375;0.9622641509433962;22.41;13.9;11.33;15.0;16.29;16.8

**Decision Rule**:  
Access is granted if, for each support of every prohibition, there's a supporting permission where each element of the permission is more preferred than the corresponding element in the prohibition. This is known as dominance, where each element in the permit's support is strictly preferable to at least one in the prohibition’s support.

**Outcome**:  
Ben_Fodor is granted access to perform ""sign"" on ""report5"".

**Relations and Preferences**:

1. **Permitted Actions (Permutations)**:
   - **Permutation 1**: University1 allows full professors to validate on WP2 with a secondment.
   - **Permitation 2**: University3 allows team leaders to validate on WP3 with a secondment.

2. **Prohibited Actions (Prohibitions)**:
   - Institute3 prohibits secondees from validating on WP5 with a default context.
   - Institute3 also prohibits staff members from validating on WP3 with default.
   - University2 prohibits postdocs from validating on public_data with default.

3. **Preferences**:
   - **Roles**: full_professor (U1) > secondee (I3), team_leader (U3) > staff_member (I3), post_doc (U2) > full_professor, and secondment (varies) > default.

4. **Dominance Analysis**:
   - Each permitted element (e.g., full_professor, team_leader, post_doc) is strictly preferred over the corresponding prohibited elements (secondee, staff_member, full_professor) in their respective contexts.
   - Contexts like secondment (U1) and default (I3, U2) are also considered, with secondment being preferred over default.

**Analysis**:
The access is granted because each prohibited action's support is dominated by a corresponding permitted action's support. For example, full_professor in U1 is preferred over seconee in I3, and the secondment context is preferred over default. Similarly, team_leader in U3 is preferred over staff_member in I3, ensuring that Ben_Fodor can perform the necessary actions without violating any prohibiations.";0.8126057942708332;0.9125162760416666;0.8482666015625;0.9599609375;0.9365234375;0.59423828125;0.9583333333333334;21.6;14.2;12.67;15.1;17.28;17.3

The access was granted due to the dominance of the permission supports over the prohibition supports, based on role and context preferences. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Role Preferences**: wp_leader is the most preferred role, followed by associate_professor and PhD_student, with team_leader being the least preferred in specific contexts.

2. **Context Preferences**: Secondment is the highest priority, followed by collaboration and then default.

3. **Specific Comparisons**:
   - The collaboration context in University1 is overridden by wp_leader.
   - Default context in University1 benefits from full_professor's support.
   - Team_leader in Institute2 supersedes PhD_student in some contexts.
   - Secondment in multiple organizations surpasses collaboration and default in their respective contexts.

The access decision was determined by evaluating whether each permission's support dominantly supported the corresponding prohibition's support, considering role and context precedence.

1. **Precedence of Roles**:
   - **wp_leader** is the highest-preferred role, followed by **full_professor**, **associate_professor**, **PhD_student**, and **team_leader**.

2. **Importance of Contexts**:
   - Among contexts, **secondment** has the highest priority, succeeded by **collaboration**, and then **default**.

3. **Detailed Comparisons**:
    - **wp_leader (University1)** surpasses **PhD_student (University1)** in collaboration context.
    - **full_professor (University1)** outperforms **PhD_student** in default context.
    - In University1, **wp_leader** and **full_professor** both dominate over **PhD_student**
    - **team_leader (Institute2)** takes precedence over **associate_profector (University1)**

The access was granted due to the dominance of each permission's support over its corresponding prohibition's, considering role and contextual precedence. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Role Precedence**:
   - wp_leader is the highest, followed by full_professor, associate_professor, PhD_student, and team_leader.

2. **Context Priority**:
   - secondment is the highest priority, followed by collaboration, then default.

3. **Comparisons**:
   - In University1:
     - wp_leader and full_professor dominate PhD_student in collaboration contexts.
     - wp_leader, full_professor, and PhD_student dominate in default contexts.
   - In Institute2:
     - team_leader dominates associate_professor in secondment contexts.
     - secondment dominates collaboration and default in other contexts.

All prohibitions were dominated by their respective permissions, leading to access being granted.";0.4290000915527344;0.3559977213541667;0.2671521504720052;0.476318359375;0.199951171875;0.1544189453125;0.9444444444444444;9.45;14.7;13.24;14.4;21.96;19.3

**Explanation:**

1. **The decision rule is:** Access is granted if for each support of the prohibition, there is a corresponding support for the permission such that the permission's support strictly dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance is defined as each element of the permutation's support being strictly preferred to at minimum one element of the prohibition’s support.

2. **The outcome is:** The permission for Ursular_Carter to perform the read activity on report7 in the organization University1 is granted.

3. **The relations and preferences that led to the decision:**
   - **Relation 1:** The employment of Ursula_Carter as a researcher in University1 is preferred over her employment as a post_doc in Institute2. This is because the role ""researcher"" is considered more preferable than ""post_doc.""
   - **Relation II:** The context audit holds in University1, which is preferred over the context default holding in Institute2. Audit is considered more favorable than default.

The decision outcome is that ""Amelia_KING"" is granted permission to perform ""select” on “deliverable1” due to the dominance of the permutation's supports over the prohibited supports in all relevant contexts.

**3. Relations Among Supports and Preferences**:  
- **Institute3**:  
  - **Role**: Amelia_King as researcher, full_professor, and coordinator.  
  - **Activity**: Consultation on public_data, WP4, and WP1.  
  - Each role's support is preferred over the corresponding prohibition in their respective contexts.  
- **Context Management**:  
  - In Institute3, the use of ""manage context"" is preferred over ""default context"" in all activities.  
- **Preferences**:  
  - Researcher > PhD_student, Post_doc, and Coordinator.  
  - Management > default in all contexts.  
  - Full_professor > Post_doc.  
  - Coordinator > PhD_student.  
  - Secondment > default.  

Thus, the dominance condition is satisfied across all relevant supports and contexts, leading to the permission being granted.";0.7228790283203125;0.489959716796875;0.2623748779296875;0.9794921875;0.97216796875;0.089599609375;0.9601990049751243;18.96;15.2;14.53;16.8;17.69;18.8

But the user still didn't get enough details. Now, I need to provide a step-by-step explanation of the decision-making process, using the given logic, supports of permission, supports of prohibition, and the preferences between the elements. 

Step 1: Identify all the supports for permissions and prohibitions. 

Step 2: For each support in the prohibitions, find a corresponding support in permissions where each element is preferred. 

Step 3: Use the provided preferences to determine dominance. 

Step 4: Conclude whether access is granted or denied based on dominance.
Okay, so I need to figure out why the access was granted. Let me start by understanding the problem. There are permissions and prohibitions based on certain supports, and the decision is made by checking if the permissions dominate the prohibitions.

First, I'll list out all the supports for both permissions and prohibitions.

For permissions, there are three supports:
1. Institute3: role researcher, context between Amelia_King selecting and deliverable1.
2. University2: role full_professor; same context.
3. University3: role coordinator; same context.

For prohibitions, there are also three supports, each from different organizations:
1. Institute2: role PhD_student; context default.
2. Institute3: post_doc; context default.
3. Institute3: another support? Wait, no, each support is per organization.

Wait, actually, looking back, the supports for prohibitions are:
- Institute2: PhD_student, context default.
- Institute3: post_doC, context default.
Wait, no, the third support for prohibitions isn't mentioned. Wait, the user provided three supports for permissions and three for prohibitions. Let me check:

Looking back, the user provided:

Supports of Permission:
- Support 1: Institute3, researcher
- Support 2: University2, full_professor
- Support 3: University3, coordinator

Supports of Proihilation:
- Support1: Institute2, PhD_student
- Support2: Institute3, post_doC
- Support3: University2, another role? Wait, the user wrote:

Wait, in the initial prompt, the user listed:

3. Supports of Prohibition:
   (support 1): Institute2 grants PhD_student...
   (support 2): Institute3 grants post_doC...
   (support3): University2 grants another role? Or is it University3?

Wait, let me re-examine the user's message.

In the initial prompt, under 3. Supports of Permutation, there are three:

1. Institute3
2. University2
3. University3

Under 3. Supports for Prohibition:

1. Institute2
2. Institute3
3. University2

Wait, no, in the user's message, under 3., the supports for prohibition are:

(support 1) Institute2, PhD
(support 2) Institute3, post_doc
(support 3) University2, something? Or is it another?

Wait, looking back:

The user wrote:

3. **Sup of Prohibition:** 
   (support 3): The org University3 considers select as consult, uses deliverable1, context secondment holds.

Wait, no, perhaps the user made a mistake. Let me check the initial prompt.

Wait, the user's point 3 says:

3. **Support of Prohibition:** It's a list of three, but the user might have miscounted. Let me see:

Wait, the user wrote under 3.:

3. **List of the elements which compose the prohibition support:**
   (support1): Institute2, PhD...
   (support2): Institute3, post...
   (support...): Maybe the third is University3? Or is it elsewhere?

Wait, perhaps the user intended to have three supports for both permission and prohibition. Let me recount:

Permutation supports: 3
Prohibition supports: 3

So, for each of the three prohibition supports, we need to find a corresponding permutation support that dominates it.

Now, the decision rule is: For each support of the forbidden (prohibition), there must be a corresponding support of the allowed (permission) where each element in the permutation's support is strictly preferred to the corresponding element in the prohibition's support.

So, for each i from 1 to 3, support i of prohibition must be dominated by support i of permission.

So, let's pair them:

1. Prohibition support1: Institute2 grants PhD, context default.

We need to find a permutation support where the elements are strictly preferred.

Looking at the permutation supports:

- Institute3: researcher, context management
- University2: full_professor, context management (I think)
- University3: coordinator, context secondment

So, for the first prohibition support (Institute2, PhD, default context), we need a permutation support where:

- The role is preferred to PhD (i.e., researcher or full_professor or coordinator)
- The context is preferred to default (i.e., management or secondment)

So, let's see:

Permutation support1: researcher, management. Is researcher preferred to PhD? Yes. Management preferred to default? Yes.

So, support1 of permutation dominates support1 of prohibition.

Similarly, for support2 of prohibition (Institute3, post_doc, default context):

Find a permutation support where role > post_doc and context > default.

Looking at permutation supports:

Institute3: researcher, management
University2: full_prof, management
University3: coord, secondment

So:

Institute3's role (researcher) > post_doc? Yes.

Context: management > default? Yes.

Thus, support1 of permutations (Institute3) dominates support2 of prohibition.

Next, support3 of prohibition: University2 grants some role, context WP3, default context.

Wait, the original user wrote:

In the 3. **Sup. of Prohibition**, the third support is:

(support3): The org. University2 grants ... to perform consult on WP3 using deliverable1, with context default.

Wait, that seems similar to support2, but maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the third support is from University3.

Wait, the initial user message says:

Under 3., the prohibits have three supports:

1. Institute x, PhD, default
2. Institute x, post_doC, default
3. University x, something, default

Wait, perhaps the third is University2, but the user may have mixed up the roles.

Alternatively, perhaps the third prohibition support is from University2, but with a different role.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify. Let me look again.

In the user's initial prompt:

Under 2. Supports of Permission, there are three: Institute3, University2, University3.

Under 3., Supports of Prohibition, the user lists three:

1. institute2, phd
2. institute3, post_do
3. university2, ... ?

Wait, the third support is unclear. Perhaps it's another role in university2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and the third is from university3.

But regardless, for the sake of this exercise, I'll assume that each of the three prohibitions has a corresponding permutation support.

So, moving forward, for each prohibition support, find a permutation support that dominates.

Assuming that for each i=1,2,3, the i-th permutation support dominates the i-th prohibition support.

Thus, the access is granted.

Now, the user said that the first answer didn't cover the relations and preferences well, so I need a more detailed explanation.

I think the key points are:

1. For each prohibition support, there's a permutation support where each element in permutation is strictly preferred.

2. The preferences between roles and contexts are considered.

So, step-by-step:

1. Identify all permutation and prohibition supports.

2. For each i, check if permutation support i dominates prohibition support i.

3. If all do, access granted.

**1. Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if, for each element in the permission's support, there exists an element in the corresponding prohibition's support such that the permission's element is strictly preferred over the prohibition's element.

**2. Outcome:**  
The permission for Frank_Harry to perform ""add"" on ""agreement3"" is granted.

**3. Relations and Preferences:**

- **Relation 1:**  
  - **Permission Support:** ""The organization Institute3 employs Frank_Harry in the role researcher.""  
  - **Prohibition Support:** ""The context audit holds...""  
  - **Preference:** Researcher > Secondee, Audit > Collaboration, Researcher > Post_doc, Associate_Professor > Secondee.

- **Relation 2:**  
  - ""The context audit..."" (Institute3) > ""The context collaboration..."" (University3).

- **Relation 3:**  
  - Same as Relation 1 but for Institute1 and Post_doc.

- Etc. (List all relevant relations with their preferences.)

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Compare Each Permission Support with Each Prohibition Support:**
   - Each permission element is checked against each prohibition element to see if it's strictly preferred.

1. **Decision Rules**: Access is granted only if, for each support in the prohibition, there's a corresponding support in the permission where each element in the permission's support is strictly preferred over the corresponding element in the prohibition's support. This requires dominance, where every element in the permutation's support is more preferred than the corresponding element in its counterpart.

2. **Outcome Analysis**: The outcome depends on comparing the preferences between the two sets of supports. Specifically, we need to check if the permutation's supports (University2, wp_leader, audit) are strictly preferred over the prohibition's (University3, post_doc, collaboration). 

3. **Relation and Preferences**:
    - **Organizational Preference**: University2 > University3
    - **Role Preference**: wp_leader > post_doc
    - **Context Preference**: audit > collaboration

**1. Decision Rule:**  
The access is granted if, for each support of prohibited actions, there exists a supporting action for the permitted behavior where the permitted action's support dominates the prohibited action's support. Dominance is established when each element of the permitted action's components is strictly preferred to some element in the prohibited action's components.

**2. Outcome:**  
The permission for Quinn_Thomson to perform the activity ""cat"" on ""agreement2"" is granted.

**3. Relations and Preconditions:**

a. **Role Preferences:**  
   - The role ""coordinator"" is preferred over ""PhD_student"" because ""coordinator"" holds a higher precedence.  
   - The position ""full_professor"" is favored over ""PhDStudent"" due to its higher rank.  

b. **Context Preferences:**  
   In University1, ""context management"" is more preferred than ""context default.""  
   In Institute1, ""context audit"" is more preferred compared to ""context default.""  

c. **Common Elements:**  
   - ""Quinn_Thomson"" is present in all roles and contexts, but it doesn't directly influence the dominance.  
   - ""cat"" is the action being executed in both the permitted and prohibited supports.  
   - Both permissions and prohibitions involve ""agreement2,"" the target of the action.  

d. **Dominance Evidence:**  
   - Each element in the permitted support (e.g., ""coordinator"", ""full_professor"", ""cat"", ""agreement2"") is more preferred than the corresponding elements in the prohibited support.  
   - This dominance ensures that the conditions for granting access are fully satisfied.  

e. **Conclusion:**  
   The dominance of the permitted support over the prohibited support, supported by the individual element preferences, leads to the decision that the permission is granted.";0.863525390625;0.94775390625;0.6119384765625;0.9755859375;0.92822265625;0.1458740234375;0.9539748953974896;30.36;12.9;12.92;15.3;16.06;16.2

1. **DecisionRule**: The access is granted when, for each support of the prohibition, there exists an element in the permission's support that is strictly preferred to it. This ensures that the permission's support adequately covers the prohibition's requirements through dominance.

2. **Outcomes**: The decision outcome is that Bob_Smith is granted the permission to sign report1. This is because the dominance conditions are met, ensuring that the permission's requirements are sufficiently covered by the existing supports.

3. **Reasoning and Preferences**:
   a. **Employment Preference**: The employment of Bob_Smith as a team_leader in University1 is more preferred than his role as a secondee in Institute3. This preference aligns with the organizational structure favoring team leadership over secondary roles.
   b. **Contextual Preference**: The secondment context, involving Bob_Smith, signing, and report1, is more favorable than the collaboration context. This preference emphasizes the importance of temporary placements over collaborative roles in this context.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.";2077;1801;"Alright, let's try to figure out why the access was granted. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I need to understand the overall logic. The access is granted if, for each support in the prohibition, there's a corresponding support in the permission where the permission’s support dominates the prohibition’s. Dominance means that each element in the permission's support is strictly preferred over at least one element in the prohibition's support.

Okay, so I need to look at each support in the prohibitions and check if there's a corresponding permission support that dominates it.

Let me list out the prohibitions first. There are five supports for prohibitions:

1. Support 1: University1 grants associate_professor the prohibition.
2. Support 2: University1 grants post_doc.
3. Support 3: University1 grants another post_doc.
4. Support 4: University1 grants secondee.
5. Support 5: Institute3 grants PhD_student.

And the permissions have their own supports:

1. For modify on WP5: University2 with wp_leader.
2. For modify onWP1: Institute3 with team_leader.
3. For modify on VP2: University1 with associate_professor and post_doc.
4... Wait, actually, looking back, the permissions are for different views: modify on WP5, modify on WP1, modify on VP2, modify on VP4, modify on WP2, etc. So each permission is tied to a specific view and role.

Wait, maybe I need to map each permission to its view and role. Let me see:

From the user's message, the permissions are:

- perm1: modify WP5 (University2, wp_leader)
- perm2: modify WP1 (Institute3, team_leader)
- perm3: modify VP2 (University1, associate_professor)
- perm4: modify VP4 (University1, secondee)
- perm5: modify WP2 (University1 and Institute3, post_doc and PhD_student)

Wait, no, perm5 is modify on WP2 for both University1 and Institute3? Or is it multiple permissions?

Wait, the user's message is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again.

Looking back, the user lists:

- Supports of Permission: two supports, each with University2 and University1, etc.

- Supports of Prohibition: five supports, each with different organizations and roles.

Then, the preferences between the elements, which seem to compare the strengths of different organizational roles and contexts.

The decision outcome is that the permission for Wendy to perform move on agree4 is granted.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the context audit in University2 is preferred over the collaboration in University1, and the role wp_leader is preferred over associate_professor, post_doc, etc.

So, for the permission to be granted, each prohibition's support must have a corresponding permission's support where the permission's elements are strictly preferred.

Looking at the dominances:

Each element in the permission support must be strictly preferred to at lease one element in the corresponding prohibition support.

So, for example, if a prohibition support has elements A, B, C, the permission support must have at least one element that is strictly preferred to A, B, or C.

Wait, but the dominance is that each element of the permission's support must dominate at least one of the prohibition's support. Or is it that the entire permission's support as a whole must dominate the prohibition's support?

I think it's the latter: the entire set of the permission's elements must dominate the entire set of prohibited elements.

But the dominance is defined per element: each element in permission's support must be strictly better than at least one in the prohibition's.

Wait, the definition says: ""each element of the permission’s support is strictly preferred to atleast one element of the prohibition’s support.""

So, for each element in the permutation support, there must be at least one element it's strictly preferred over in the prohibition support.

But since the dominance is about the entire support, I think it's that the entire set of permission's elements must collectively dominate the prohibition's set.

But the exact definition is that for each element in permission, there's an element in prohibition that it's strictly preferred to.

Wait, no, the definition is: ""Dominance means that: Each element of the supportof the permission is strictlypreferred to at least oneelement of the support ofthe prohibition.""

So, for every element in the permission, there exists an element in the prohibition that it is strictly preferred to.

So, for each p in P (permission support), there exists a q in Q (prohibition support) such that p is strictly preferred to q.

Therefore, to satisfy the condition, for each q in Q, there must exist a p in P such that p > q.

Wait, no. The condition is that for each support of the prohibition (each q in Q), there exists a support of the permission (each p in P) where p dominates q.

Wait, the initial statement says: ""Access is granted if andonly if, for eachsupport of a prohibition,there exists a corresponding supportfor a permissionwhere the permission's supportdominates theprohibition's.""

So, it's not that for each p, there's a q, but that for each q, there's a p that dominates it.

So, the condition is: For every q in Q (each support of prohibition), there exists a p in P (each support of permission) such that p dominates q.

And p dominates q if every element in p is strictly preferred over some element in q.

Wait, more precisely, the dominance is defined as: each element of p is strictly preferredto at least one elementof q.

So, for p to dominate q, for every p_element in p, there exists a q_element in q such that p_element > q_element.

Therefore, for each q, we need at least one p that dominates it, i.e., for every q, there exists a p where every element of p is > some element of q.

So, in the user's case, they have multiple supports for both permission and prohibition.

The user has two supports for permission:

1. perm1: University2, wp_leader; context audit in U2
2. perm2: Institute3, team_leader; context management in I3

And five supports for prohibition:

1. prob1: U1, associate_prof; context collaboration
2. prob2: U1, post_doc; context collaboration
3. prob3: same as 2
4. prob4: U1, seconder; context collaboration
5. prob5: I3, PhD_student; context default

Then, the user lists preferences between the elements. For example, University2's wp_leader is more preferred than U1's associate_professor, etc.

Now, to determine if the access is granted, we need to check for each prohibition support, whether there's a permission support that entirely dominates it.

Let's take the first prohibition support: prob1 is U1, role associate_prof, context collaboration.

We need to see if any of the permission supports (perm1 or perm2) dominate prob1.

Perm1: U2, role wp_leader, context audit.

Check if perm1's elements dominate prob1's.

For perm1 to dominate prob1, every element in perm1 must be > some element in prob1.

But perm1 has two elements: U2 and context audit.

Similarly, prob1 has U1 and context collaboration.

So, does U2 > U1? According to the preferences, yes, because U2 is more preferred.

Does context audit > context collaboration? Yes, audit is preferred over collaboration.

Therefore, perm1's support (U2, audit) dominates prob1's (U1, collaboration).

So, for prob1, perm1 is a dominating support.

Similarly, check perm2: I3, team_leader, context management.

Does I3 > U1? No, because U1 is more preferred than I3.

So, perm2 does not dominate prob1.

Therefore, for prob1: perm1 dominates.

Similarly, for prob2: same as prob1, but role is post_doc.

Check perm1: U2 wp_leader, audit.

U2 > U1, audit > collaboration. So yes, perm1 dominates prob2.

Same for prob3, which is same as prob2.

For prob4: same as prob2, but role is secondee.

Again, perm1 (U2, wp_leader, audit) > U1, so dominates.

prob5: I3 PhD_student, default.

Check perm2:";0.5085009765625;0.808746337890625;0.558221435546875;0.146728515625;0.78955078125;0.7607421875;0.9808;49.11;9.8;7.49;12.7;11.01;10.3

1. **DecisionRule**: The access is granted based on the dominance condition. For each prohibition support, there exists a permission support where every element (role/context) in the permission is strictly preferable to the corresponding element in the prohibition.

2. **Outcomes**:
   - The access is granted for the modification of ""move"" on ""agreement4"" by ""Wendy_Mitchell"" due to the dominance of the permission support (University2 with role wp_leader and context audit) over the prohibition support (University1 with role associate_professor and context collaboration).

3. **RelationsandPreferences**:
   - **Preference Strengths**: The role ""wp_leader"" in University2 is more preferred than ""associate_professor"", ""post_doc"", ""secondee"", and ""PhD_student"". The context ""audit"" is more preferred than both ""collaboration"" and ""default"".
   - **Domination**: The permission support (University₂, wp_leader, audits) dominates the prohibition support (U₁, associate_professor, collaboration) because ""wp_leader"" > ""associate_professor"" and ""audit"" > ""collaboration"".

- **Decision Rule**:
  Access is granted if for each 'Prohibitions', there exists a corresponding 'Permission'. Each element of the 'Permission's support' is strictly preferred to the corresponding element in the 'Prohibition's support'.

- **Outcome**:
  Mia Anderson is granted 'Read' access on 'dataset9'.

- **Details**:
  - **Roles**: The highest preference is given to 'Coordinator', followed by 'Team_leader', then 'Post_doc', 'Secondee', and 'PhD_student'.
  - **Contexts**: 'Audit' has the highest priority, followed by 'Secondment' and 'Default'.
  - **Organizational Preference**: 'Institute1' is preferred over 'University3'.

- **Matching Process**:
  - The highest-preferred 'Permission' that dominates each 'Prohibition' is selected.
  - For example, 'Coordinators' in 'Institute1 have higher priority than 'Post_docs' in 'Institutes3'.

- **Conclusion**:

- **Decision Rule**:  
  The access is granted based on the dominance of permissions over prohibitions. Each element in the permission's support must be strictly preferred to the respective element in the prohibition's support.

- **Outcome**:  
  The decision outcome is that Mia Anderson is granted the permission to perform the ""Read"" action on the ""dataset9"" resource.

- **Details**:  
  - **Role Preferences**: The hierarchy of role preferences is as follows: Coordinator (highest), followed by Team_leader, Post_doc, Secondee, and PhD_student (lowest).  
  - **Context Preferences**: The context preferences are ordered as Audit (highest), Secondment, and Default (lowest). Additionally, the organizational preference favors Institute1 over University3.  
  - **Matching Process**:  
    - The highest-preference permission (Coordinator in Institute1) dominates the highest-preference prohibition (Post_doc in Institute3).  
    - Similarly, Team_leader in Institute1 dominates Post_doc in University3.  
    - This pattern continues, ensuring that each prohibition is dominated by a higher-preference permission.  
    - The lowest-preference permission (PhD_student in University3) dominates the Default context in University3.  

- **Conclusion**:  
  By systematically matching the highest-preference permissions to each corresponding prohibition, the system ensures that all access control rules are satisfied, thereby granting Mia Anderson the desired access.";0.8344780815972221;0.7808430989583334;0.7050238715277778;0.9794921875;0.873046875;0.166015625;0.9672131147540983;4.88;16.5;13.68;16.2;20.99;20.3

**3. Relationships and Reasons:**  

- **Role Preferences:**  
  - **Researcher > Staff Member > Associate Professor:** Liam_Taylor holds a higher-preference role (researcher) compared to staff and associate roles, which justifies the access.

- **Context Preferences:**  
  -(1) **Secondment > Collaboration > Default:** The secondment context (institute3) is preferred over collaboration (institute2) and default (university2), supporting the access.

  -(2) **Audit > Collaboration, Default:** Audit context (institute1) is more favorable than collaboration and default contexts, ensuring the dominance condition is met.

- **Action Contexts:**  
  - The specific actions (modify on WP5, data, WP4, reports) are consistent across all relevant supports, maintaining uniformity in the decision-making process.

**1. Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if, for each element of the prohibition's support, there exists an element in the permission's support where the permission's element is strictly preferred to the prohibition's element.

**2. Outcome:**  
The permission to create on dataset1 by Eva_Clark is granted.

**3. Relations and Preferences:**  
- **Organizational Structures:**  
  - **Institute3:**  
    - **Role Coordinator:** Eva_Clark in role, dataset1 used, context audit holds.  
    - **Permission:** Modify internal_data.  
    - Context audit holds.  
  - **Role wp_leader:** Eva_Clark, context management holds.  
    Permits modifying internal_data.  
  - Other roles (researcher, associate_professor, post_doc) have their own contexts (secondment, collaboration, default) but do not affect this decision.  

- **Preferences:**  
  - ""Coordinator"" is preferred over ""post_doc,"" ""wp_leader,"" and ""associate_professor.""  
  - ""Auditor"" context is preferred over ""default,"" ""collaboration,"" and ""secondment.""  
  - Specific organizational mentions (""Institute3,"" ""University3,"" ""University1"") do not affect the decision.  

**Explanation:**  
1. **Step 1:** Identify the relevant permission and prohibition supports.  
   - The permission is to modify dataset1.  
   - One relevant prohibition is the context audit holding.  

2. **Step 2:** Check if the permission's support is strictly preferred.  
   - In Institute3, the role is coordinator, which is preferred over other roles.  
   - Context audit is preferred over default and collaboration.  

3. **Step 3:** Since all conditions are met, access is granted.  

**Conclusion:**  
The access is granted because Eva_Clark's role (coordinator) and the context (audit) meet the strict preference criteria.";0.6223244984944661;0.23102823893229166;0.20212745666503906;0.96337890625;0.90966796875;0.194580078125;0.9553571428571429;26.47;12.3;10.14;12.9;17.15;16.8

**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Eva_Clark to perform create on dataset1 is granted. 
**Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.";3185;297;"

**1. Decision Rules:**
Access is granted when, for each element in the prohibition’s support, there exists a strictly preferred element in the permission’s support. This involves checking the hierarchy of roles and contexts across different organizational structures.

---

**2. Outcome:**
The access is granted for Eva_Clark, allowing her to perform the create action on dataset1. This is based on the alignment of her role and the context with the required preferences.

---

**3. Relations & Preferences:**

- **Organizational Roles and Preferences:**
  - **Role Hierarchy:** Coordinator > wp_leader > associate_professor > post_doc
  - **Context Preferences:** Audit > default > collaboration > secondment

- **Specific Cases:**
  - In Institute3:
    - **Role:** Coordinator is preferred over other positions.
    - **Context:** Audit is preferred over default, collaboration, and secondment.

- **Impact on Decision:**
  - Eva_Clark’s role as Coordinator in Institute3 meets the highest preference for roles.
  - The context audit within Institute3 is the most preferred context, ensuring the dominance condition is satisfied.

---

**Explanation:**
The decision is made by evaluating Eva_Clark's highest-priority role (Coordinator) and the most preferred context (Audit) within Institute3. These elements meet the strict preference requirements, thereby granting the access. The absence of conflicting roles and contexts from other organizations does not affect this specific decision.";0.7342964172363281;0.459716796875;0.4117164611816406;0.9814453125;0.93701171875;0.118408203125;0.9805825242718447;20.48;14.6;13.21;15.3;18.21;18.9

An access is granted if and only if,         for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.         Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.

**1. Decision Rules:**  
Access is permitted when, for each element in the prohibition, a corresponding element in the permission exists where the permission's element is strictly preferred to the prohibition's.

**2. Outcomes:**  
Vera Clark is granted permission to create on dataset 1 within Institute3.

**3. Relationships and Preferences:**

1. **Role Preferences:**
   - **Institute3:**  
     - Eva_Clark holds the role of Coordinator, which is ranked higher than post_doc, associate_professor, and researcher.
   - **Other Organizations:**  
     - Lower-ranked roles (post_doc, associate_profector, researcher) do not affect the current decision.

2. **Context Preferences:**  
   - The context 'Audit' is the highest priority, followed by 'collaboration', 'default', 'secondment', and 'management'.

3. **Dominance Verification:**
   - Each prohibition in Institute3 has a corresponding permission with a higher preference in both role and context.
   - Prohibitions from other organizations are disregarded as their roles and contexts fall lower in the preference list.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   - Since the highest permitted role and context (Coordinator and Audit) satisfy all prohibitions, Eva_Clark's access is granted.";0.6544815063476562;0.249420166015625;0.18985748291015625;0.97705078125;0.96826171875;0.1121826171875;0.9440993788819876;20.38;14.6;14.12;16.0;17.63;18.7

2. **Outcome**:
The access is granted forBen_Foster to perform 'sign' on'report3'.

3. **RelationsandPreferences**:
- **PermissionSupport**:
  - Ben_Foster is employed in the role full Professor.

- **Prohibition Support**:
  - Employed in the role post Doctorate.
  - Uses sign in view Administration.
  - Context collaboration holds betweenBen-Foster, sign,andreport3.
- **Preferences**:
  - full Professor is preferred to post Doctorate.
    - This is because full Professor is a higher academic rank.
  - Secondment is preferred to Collaboration.
    - This could be due to the nature of the work involved in a secondment being more specialized or project-focused compared to collaboration.

By comparing the two supports, the dominance conditions are satisfied because the elements in the permission support are strictly preferred to those in the prohibition support.

1. **The decision rule is:**
Access is granted if, according to the given logic, for every support in the prohibition list, there must be a matching support in the permission list such that the permission's support entirely dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance is defined as each element in the permission's support being strictly preferred over at least one element in the prohibition's support.

2. **The outcome is:**
The access is granted for the role of Amelia_King to execute the action ""describe"" on the object ""agreement6.""

3. **The relations and preferences that led to the decision:**
   a. **University3's Employment Preference:**
      - The employment of Amelia_KING in the role of full_professor at University3 is preferred over her employment as associate_professor at Institute2. This preference stems from the fact that full_professor is a higher academic rank compared to associate_professor.

   b. **Contextual Preference:**
      i. **Secondment Context:** The context where Amelia_King is involved in a secondment with ""describe"" and ""agreement6"" at University3 is considered more favorable than the default secondment context at Institute2. The term ""secondment"" is preferred over the default context, indicating a higher level of involvement or specific assignment.

**1. Decision Rule**:  
Access is granted if, for every support of a prohibited activity, there exists a supporting permission whose support strictly dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance is determined by each element of the permission's support being strictly preferred to at leas one element of the prohibition's support.

**2. Outcome**:  
The decision outcome is that the permission for Ben-Foster to perform the read activity on agreement1 has been granted.

**3. Relations and Preferences**:  
- **Supports of Permissions**:  
  - **Support 1**: University1 grants Ben-Foster the permission to consult on view data with context management.  
  - **_support 2**: Institute3 grants Ben-Foster permission to consult on public_data with context management.  

- **Preferences Between Elements**:  
  - ""University1 employs Ben-Foster in team_leader"" is preferred over ""University2 employs Ben-Foster..."" and ""Institute2 employs..."" because team_leader > post_doc and team_leader > staff_member.  
  - ""Context management"" is preferred over both ""context collaboration"" and ""context default"" because management > collaboration and management > default.  

- **Dominance Analysis**:  
  - For each prohibition support, the corresponding permission's support (e.g., team_leader, management) is strictly preferred to the prohibition's elements (post_doc, collaboration, default).  
  - This dominance ensures that the permission's conditions are sufficiently strong to override the prohibitions.

**1. DecisionRule:**  
Access is granted when, for each prohibition's support, there's a corresponding permission's support that strictly dominates it. Dominance occurs when each element in the permission's support is preferred over at least one element in the prohibition's support based on the defined preferences.

**2. Outcomes:**  
The decision outcome allows Ben-Foster to read on agreement1.

**3. Reasons and Preferences:**

- **Permitted Actions and Their Supports:**
  - **Permission 1 (University1):** Allows Ben-Foster to consult view data using context management.
  - **Permission2 (Institute3):** Permits consulting public_data with the same context management.

- **Prohibited Actions and Their Supports:**  
  - **Prohibition1 (University2):** Restricts Ben-Foster from consulting WP1 using context collaboration.
  - **Proihilation2 (Institute2):** Prohibits Ben-Foster from interacting with WP3 via context collaboration.
  – **Prohibition3 (Institute1):** Disallows consulting internal_data with context default.

- **Preference Hierarchy:**
  - Roles: team_leader (most preferred) > post_doc > staff_member.
  - Context Types: management > collaboration > default.

- **Dominance Check:**
  - Prohibitions are dominated by their corresponding permissions because:
    - team_leader is preferred over post_doc and staff_member.
    - management context is preferred over collaboration and default.

- **Conclusion:**
  - Despite having prohibitions, the dominating permissions grant access, so Ben-Foster can perform the read operation.";0.4878916422526041;0.22544352213541666;0.17251078287760416;0.93798828125;0.93994140625;0.83642578125;0.9536082474226804;7.11;15.6;14.1;15.3;21.92;21.1

**1. Decision Rule:**  
Access is allowed if, for every prohibition's support, the corresponding permission's support strictly dominates it. This dominance is determined by two key factors: the preference of roles (e.g., team_leader over post_doc) and the preference of context types (e.g., management over collaboration or default).

**2. Outcome:**  
Ben-Foster is granted permission to read on agreement₁.

**3. Details Influencing the Decision:**

- **Role Preferences:**
  - Team_leader is the highest priority role, followed by post_doc and staffMember.
  - This hierarchy dictates that permissions associated with higher roles take precedence.

- **Context Type Preferences:**
  Higher priority context types include management, then collaboration, and finally default.

- **Permitted and Prohibited Actions:**
  - Permitted: 
    - University1's team_leader role allows consulting view data with context Management.
    - Institute3's role permits consulting public_data with context Management.
  - Prohibited:
    - University2's post_doc role prohibits consulting WP1 with context Collaboration.
    - Institute2's role prohibits consulting WP3 with context Collaboration.
      - Institute1's staffMember role prohibits consulting internalData with context Default.

- **Domination Analysis:**
  - Each prohibited action is dominated by a corresponding permitted action because the roles and context types in the permitted actions are preferred over those in the prohibited ones.
  - For instance, the management context in permitted actions supersedes the collaboration and default contexts in the prohibited actions.

- **Conclusion:**  
  Despite the presence of prohibitions, the superior permissions (based on role and context type preferences) grant access, allowing Ben-Foster to perform the read operation on agreement₁.";0.5933074951171875;0.3380940755208333;0.2534434000651042;0.958984375;0.96923828125;0.55322265625;0.95;14.97;14.7;12.56;15.3;19.54;18.2

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Decision Rule:**
   - Access is granted if for each prohibition, there exists an enabling permission where the role and context type in the permission are more preferred than those in the prohibition.

2. **Breaking Down Roles and Contexts:**
   - **Roles Hierarchy:** Team_leader > Post_doc > Staff_member.
   - **Context Type Hierarchy:** Management > Collaboration > Default.

3. **Analyzing Permissions and Prohibitions:**
   - Ben-Foster has permissions:
     - Read on agreement1 with Management context.
     - Read on public_data with Management context.
   - Prohibitions:
     - Post_doc in University2 can't consult WP1 with Collaboration.
     - Staff members in Institute2 can't consultWP3 with Collaboration.
     – Staff members in Institute1 can't consult internal_data with Default.

4. **Evaluating Each Prohibition:**
   - Each prohibition is dominated by a permission with a higher role (Team_leader) and higher context (Management), thus allowing access despite the restrictions.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The superior permissions (higher roles and contexts) grant Ben-Foster access, overriding the prohibitions.

**Answer:**

The decision to grant access is based on the dominance of Ben-Foster's permissions over the existing prohibitions. By having higher priority roles (Team_leader) combined with the highest context type (Management), Ben-Foster is granted the permission to read on Agreement1, despite the existing restrictions.";0.508056640625;0.148193359375;0.1396484375;0.951171875;0.9501953125;0.64892578125;0.97;23.22;13.5;11.98;15.0;18.44;17.8

**1. Decision Rule**:  
The decision is based on the rule that access is granted if for each support in a set of permissions, a corresponding support exists in a set of prohibitions such that the permission's support *dominates* the prohibition's support. Dominance requires that every element in the permission's support is strictly preferred over by at least one element from the corresponding prohibition's support.

**2. Outcome**:  
The outcome is that Nathan_White is granted permission to perform the 'copy' activity on 'dataset1'. This is because the permission's support includes elements that are strictly preferred over those in the associated prohibition's support, satisfying the dominance condition.

**3. Relations**:  
- **Permission Supports**:  
  - **Support 2**: Nathan_White's role as a researcher, working with 'confidential_data', using 'dataset10', and the 'audit' context.  
- **Prohibition Support**:  
  - Only the 'secondee' role and 'WP2' context are prohibited, but since the permission's elements (researcher, confidential_data, dataset10, audit) are preferred over these, the dominance condition is met.  
- **Preferences**:  
  - Nathan_White's roles (researcher) are preferred over secondee.  
  - 'Audit' context is preferred over 'collaboration' and 'secondment' contexts.

**1. Decision Rule**:  
The access is granted if, for each prohibition support, there exists a permission support where each element of the permission is more preferred than the corresponding element in the prohibition.

**2. Outcome**:  
Rachel_Baker is granted permission to modify `report2`.

**3. Relations and Preferences**:  

- **Role Preferences**:  
  - `full_professor` (University2) is preferred over `post_doc` (Institute3), which is preferred over `staff_member` (Institute2).
  
- **Context Preferences**:  
  Context `audit` is preferred over `collaboration`.

**Detailed Reasoning**:  

- **Prohibition 1 (Institute2)**:  
  - Role: `staff_member`  
  - Context: `collaboration`  
  - Corresponding Permission:  
    - Role: `full_profector` (higher preference)  
    - Context: `audit` (higher preference than `collaboration`)  
  - This satisfies the dominance condition as `full_profector > staff_member` and `audit > collaboration`.  

- **Proihilation 2 (Institute3)**:  
  – Role: `post_doc`  
  – Context: `collision`  
  – Corresponding Permit:  
    – Role: `Post_doc` (same preference level)  
    – Context: `Audit` (higher than `collision`)  
  – This also satisfies the dominance condition since `post_doc` is preferred and `audit` is higher than `collision`.

**1. Decision Rules:**  
Access is determined by comparing the dominance of permission supports over their corresponding prohibition supports. A support in the permission dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission is strictly more preferred than the corresponding prohibition element.

**2. Outcome:**  
The access is granted because Wendy_Mitchell's permission to create on dataset4 meets the dominance criteria against the relevant prohibition.

**3. Relations and Preferences:**

- **Role Preferences:**  
  - `wp_leader` (University3) > `secondee` (University1) > `associate_professor` (University1 and University2).

- **Context Preferences:**  
  Context `audit` (University3 and University1) > `collaboration` (University1, University2, and University3).

- **Specific Comparisons:**
  1. **Permutation 1:**  
     - **Permission:** `wp_leader` in University3, context `audit`.
     - **Prohibition:** `secondee`, context `collaboration`.
     - **Dominance:** `wp_leader > secon dee` and `audit > collaboration`.

  2. **Permu tation 2:**  
     - No direct comparison as the permission and prohibition don't share the same role and context.

**Conclusion:**  
The dominance conditions are met for the relevant permutation, granting access for `wp_leader` to create on `dataset4`.";0.72470703125;0.761962890625;0.627197265625;0.9755859375;0.88427734375;0.62548828125;0.9006211180124224;7.01;15.6;11.89;15.5;20.18;20.4

The permission for Paul_Harry to perform ""list"" on ""deliverable1"" is granted.

**3. Relations and Preferences:**

a. **Role Preference:**  
- The role ""wp_leader"" in University1 is preferred over ""secondee"" in Institute2 because ""wp_leader"" is considered more suitable for the activity.

b. **Context Preference:**  
- ""Audit"" is preferred over ""collaboration"" because audits are more stringent and align with higher security requirements.

c. **View and Activity Alignment:**  
- The activity ""list"" is performed in ""WP3"" in University1 and in ""WP5"" in Institute2. Both views involve the same elements: ""list,"" ""Paul_Harry,"" ""Consortia,"" and ""deliverable1.""

d. **Element-wise Preference:**  
- Each element in the permission's support (e.g., ""wp_leader"") is strictly preferred over the corresponding element in the prohibition's support (""secondee"").
- Similarly, ""audit"" in the permission's context is preferred over ""collision"" in the prohibition's context.

2. The outcome is that the permission is granted.
3. The relations and preferences that led to the decision include the comparison of the supports for permission and prohibition, considering the dominance condition where each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to the corresponding element of the prohibition's support.

Okay, so I need to explain why the access was granted. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the overall logic says that access is granted if, for each support in the prohibition, there's a corresponding support in the permission where the permission’s support dominates the prohibition’s. Dominance means each element in the permission’s support is strictly preferred over at least one element in the prohibition’s support.

Looking at the supports:

- **Permission Support (Support 1):** 
  - Institute2 grants team_leader the permission to modify on view WP5 with context audit.
  - Elements: Institute2, team_leader, modify, view WP5, context audit.

- **Prohibition Support (Support1):**
  - Institute3 grants post_doc the prohibition to modify on viewWP1 with context default.
  - Elements:Istitute3, post_doc, modify, viewWP1, context default.

Now, the decision outcome is that the permutation for Liam_Taylor performing drop on report3 was granted. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me check the details again.

Wait, in the Supports of Permission, the activity is modify on the view. But the decision outcome mentions performing drop on report 3. Hmm, perhaps there's a misalignment here. Let me re-examine the problem.

Wait, the supports of permission and prohibition are about modifying a view, but the decision outcome is about performing an action (drop) on report3. Maybe there's a connection I'm missing. Perhaps the 'modify' in the supports is linked to the 'drop' action? Or maybe it's a different view?

Wait, the supports for the permission mention modifying on view WP5, and the prohibition on view WP1. The decision outcome is about report3, which might be another view or a different context. Maybe the key is that the same user (Liam_Taylor) is involved in both, but in different roles (team_leader and post_doc) in different organizations (Institute2 and Institute3). 

But the decision outcome says the permission for ""Liam_Taylor"" to perform ""drop"" on ""report3"" is granted. So, perhaps the 'drop' is a specific action, and 'report3' is a specific item in the view. So, the permission is to modify the view, but the action is to perform a specific operation (drop) on a specific report (report3).

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to focus on the logic.

The decision rule is that for each support of the prohibition, there must be a corresponding support for the permission where each element in the permutation is strictly preferred to some element in the prohibition.

Wait, no, the dominance is that each element of the permutation's support is strictly better than at least one in the prohibition's support. So, for each element in the perm's support, it's better than some in the prohibition's.

Looking at the relations and preferences:

1. ""The organisation Institute2 employs Liam_Taylor in role team_leader"" is preferred to ""The organisation Institute3 employs him in role post_doc"" because team_leader is preferred over post_doc.

2. ""The context audit holds in Institute2"" is preferred over ""The context default holds in Institute3"" because audit is preferred over default.

So, in the permutation support, we have two elements: Institute2 and team_leader. In the prohibition support, we have Institute3 and post_doc.

So, for the permutation support to dominate the prohibition support, each element in permutation's support must be strictly preferred to some in prohibition's support.

So, checking:

- Institute2 (perm) vs. Institute3 (proh): Is Institute2 preferred to Institute3? Well, the problem doesn't specify any preference between Institute2 and Institute3. It only mentions the preference between roles within the same organization.

Similarly, team_leader (perm) is preferred to post doc (proh), as per the given.

So, the key is that team_leader is preferred, but what about Institute2 vs. Institute3? It's not specified, so perhaps they are considered equal or incomparable.

But in the decision outcome, the access was granted, so perhaps the other elements (like context) also play a role.

Wait, the dominance condition requires that for each support in prohibition, there's an element in permutation that dominates it. Or is it the other way around? Wait, the condition is that for each element in prohibition's support, there's a dominating element in the permutation's support.

Wait, the condition is: for each support of prohibition, there exists correspondence in the permission's support where the permission's element dominates the prohibition's.

So, for each element x in the prohibition support, there must be an element y in the permutation support such that y is strictly preferred to x.

So, let's list the elements:

Permutation support: Institute2, Team_leader

Prohibition support: Institute3, Post_doc

So, for each x in {Institute3, Post_doc}, there must be a y in {Institute2, Team_leader} such that y > x.

We know that Team_leader > Post_doc.

But what about Institute2 compared to Institute3? The problem doesn't say anything about the preference between these two institutions. So, perhaps they are considered incomparable, meaning neither is preferred to the other.

If that's the case, then for the element Institute3 in the prohibition support:

Is there a y in permutation support (Institute2 or Team_leader) that is strictly preferred to Institute3?

If Institute2 is not preferred to Institute3, then no. Similarly, Team_leader is preferred to Post_doc, but not necessarily to Institute3.

So, perhaps the dominance condition isn't met, but the decision says it was granted. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the condition.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that the permutation's support as a whole dominates the prohibition's support, not each individual element. Or maybe it's that the permutation's entire support is dominated by the prohibition's, but I think it's the other way around.

Wait, the original condition says: ""for each support of a prohibits, there exists a correspond support for a perm where the perm's support dominates the prohibiting's.""

So, for each support S in prohibits, there's a support T in perm such that T dominates S.

Dominance is that each element in T is strictly preferred to an element in S.

So, for example, if S has elements A, B, C, and T has D, E, F, then for each element in S, there's a D, E, or F that is preferred to it.

But in our case, each support is a single element? Or are the supports sets of elements?

Wait, looking back, the supports are lists of elements that compose the support. So, the support for a permission is a set of elements, and the same for the prohibition.

So, the permutation support is a set containing Institute2 and Team_leader.

The prohibition support is a set with Institute3 and Post_doc.

So, to check if the permutation support dominates the prohibition support, for each element s in S (prohibition support), there must be a t in T (permutation support) such that t is strictly preferred to s.

So, for s = Institute3, is there a t in {Institute₂, Team_leader} where t > s?

Similarly, for s = Post_doc, is there t in T where t > Post_doc.

We know Team_leader > Post documenting.

But what about the institutions?

If the problem doesn't state any preference between Institute₂ and Institute3, then we can assume they are incomparable. So, neither is preferred over the other.

Therefore, for s=Institute3, there's no t in T where either Institute2 or Team_leader is preferred over Institute3.

Similarly, for s=Post_doc, there is a t=Team_leader who is preferred over Post_doc.

But since one of the s elements (Institute3) doesn't have a corresponding t that dominates it, the condition is not fully met.

However, the decision says the permission was granted. So, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the dominance is considered across the entire support, not per element.

Wait, I think I have a mistake here. Let me see. In the initial setup, the dominance requires that for each support in permission, there's a corresponding support in the prohibition where the permission's element is strictly preferred. But in the given explanation, it seems like the dominance is being checked for each element across all supports, not per support. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust that.

Alternatively, perhaps the logic is that for each permission support, there exists a prohibition support where the permission's elements dominate the prohibition's. So, for each element in the permission's support, it must be strictly preferred over the corresponding element in the prohibition's support.

Wait, but in the initial explanation, the user seems to have mixed up the dominance direction. Let me clarify.

In the problem statement, it says: ""Dominance means that each element of the permutation's support dominates the corresponding support of the prohibition."" Wait, no, the problem says: ""Dominating means that each element ... is strictly preferred to ...""

Wait, the problem says:

""Dominece means that: Each element of the suppo rt of the permission is stricltly preferred to at leat one element of the suppor t of the prohibition.""

Wait, no, let me re-read:

""DomineCE means that: Each elemenT of the suppo RT of the permisSion is stricTly preFerred to at leaSt one element of the suPporT of the proHibITiOn.""

So, for each element p in the permission support, there's at least one element q in the prohibition support such that p is strictly preferred to q.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, it's not that the entire set of permissions' support dominates the entire set of prohibitions' support, but rather that each individual element in the permission support is preferred to some element in the prohibition support.

So, for example, if the permission support has elements {A, B}, and the prohibition support has elements {C, D}, then for the permission to be granted, for each A and B, there must be at least one element in {C, D} that A is preferred to, and similarly for B.

But in the initial problem, both the permission and prohibition supports have the same number of elements, so it's a one-to-one correspondence.

Wait, looking back, the problem says that the access is granted if, *for each support of a prohibits*, there exists a *corresponding support* for a permission, such that the permission's support *dominates* the prohibition's.

Wait, the exact wording is:

""Access is granted if and oNly if, for each supporT of a prohibition, therE exists a correspOnding supporT for a permisSion where the permisSioN's supporT domInates the prohibition's supporT.""

So, for every support in the prohibition, there's a support in the permission where the permission support dominates the prohibition support.

And dominance is defined as: each element in the permutation's support is strictly preferable to at least one in the prohibition's.

So, for each p in permSupport, there exists q in prohibitionSupport such that p is preferred to q.

So, in the initial example, we have three supports for permission and three for prohibition.

We need to check that for each of the three prohibition supports, there exists a permutation support that dominates it.

Wait, but the initial explanation seems to have a different approach. Let me see.

In the initial problem, the user lists three supports for permission (support 1, 2, 3) and three for prohibition (support 1).

Wait, actually, in the initial problem statement, the user lists:

- Supports of permission: 3
- Supports of prohibition: 1

Wait, no, looking back:

Under ""2. Supports of Permission,"" there are three supports listed.

Under ""4. Supports of Prohibition,"" there is one support listed.

So, the decision rule is: For each support in the prohibition (which is one), there must exist a support in the permutation (which has three) such that the permutation's support dominantes the prohibition's.

But since the permutation has three supports, and the prohibition has one, we need to check that at least one of the permutation's supports dominates the prohibition's.

Each permutation support is a set of elements, and the dominance is that each element in the permSupport is strictly preferred to some in the prohibitionSupport.

Wait, but each permutation support is a list of elements, and each prohibition support is also a list of elements.

So, for the permutation support to dominate the prohibition support, for each pElement in permutationSupport, there must be a qElement in prohibitionSupport where pElement is preferred to qElement.

So, let's look at the permutation supports:

1. permSupport1: [X, X, X, X] (elements: University1 grants role full_professor to perform consult on WP2 if context secondment holds; etc.)

Wait, perhaps it's better to list the permutation and prohibition supports with their elements.

Let me try to list them more clearly.

Permutation Supports:

1. permSup1:
   - University1 grants full_professor the permission to consult WP2 if secondment holds.
   - X1: University1 employs full_professor
   - X2: consult WP2
   - X3: if secondment holds
   - X4: uses report2
   - Context: secondment between Xander, ask, report2

2. permSup2:
   - Team_leader role, consult secondment_report, audit context, Xander in team_leader, uses report2, context audit.

3. permSup3:
   - full_professor, consult WP2, audit context, uses report2.

Prohibition Support:

1. prohibitionSup1:
   grant associate_professor to consult WP1 if context collaboration holds.
   X1: Xander in associate_professor.
   X2: consult on WP1.
   X3: if context collaboration holds.

So, now, for the decision, we need to see if for the single prohibition support (prohibitionSup1), there exists at least one permutation support (from permSup1, permSup2, permSup3) such that each element in that permutation support is preferred to the corresponding elements in the prohibition support?

Wait, but the elements are not necessarily in the same order. So, perhaps we need to match the elements across supports.

Wait, perhaps the way to approach this is to map the elements of the permutation support to the prohibition support, ensuring that each permutation element is preferred to the prohibited one.

But the problem is that the elements are textual descriptions, so it's not straightforward to compare them directly. Instead, the preference is based on the roles and contexts.

Wait, the user has provided a list of preferences:

- ""The relation 'University1 employs Xander_Rod rigiduez in the rol e full_professor' is preferred to 'associate_professor' because full_professor is higher than associate_professor.""

Similarly, ""context secondment is preferred over collaboration.""

So, these are the key preferences that influence the decision.

So, perhaps the decision is based on the highest-priority element in the permutation support dominating the prohibition support.

Wait, the initial explanation says that the outcome is that the permission is granted, and the reasoning is based on the fact that the highest-priority permutation support (which is permSup1) has elements that are preferred to the prohibition support.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to structure this properly.

First, the decision rule: Access is granted iff, for each prohibition support, there's a permutation support where each element in the latter is strictly preferred to an element in the former.

Since there's only one prohibition support, we just need to find at least one permutation支持 that dominates it.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Decision Rule:**
   - Access is granted if, for every Prohibition, there's a corresponding Permission where the Permission's elements are strictly preferred to the Prohibition's elements.

2. **Analyzing the Supports:**
   - **Permitted Support:** Mia_ANDerson can sign_on_activity agreement₂ due to higher preferences in roles and contexts.
   - **Prohibited Supports:** Context collaboration in Institute₁ and management in Institute₂ are dominated by higher-priority contexts and roles.

3. **Evaluating Preferences:**
   - Contexts: Secondment > Management > Collaboration.
   - Roles: Team_Led > Associate_Prof > PhD_Student.

4. **Dominance Conditions:**
   - The higher-priority contexts (Secondment) and roles (Team_Led) in University1 dominate their counterparts in Institute1 and Institute2.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - All Prohibitions are dominated by Permitted elements, thus access is granted.

**Answer:**

The access is granted because the contexts and roles in University1 are more preferred, dominating the prohibitions in both organizations.";0.713946533203125;0.4208984375;0.25946044921875;0.9658203125;0.96923828125;0.045684814453125;0.9712230215827338;6.3;15.9;17.24;16.5;21.05;20.4

**1. Decision Rule:**  
The access is granted under the condition that for every support of a prohibition (i.e., each element in the set of prohibitions), there exists a corresponding element in the support of a permission such that the permission's support strictly dominates the prohibition's support. This dominance is determined by each element in the permutation of the permission's attributes being preferred to the corresponding elements in the prohibition's attributes.

**2. Outcome:**  
Tina_Allen is granted the permission to perform the ""sign"" action on ""dataset7"".

 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.";2199;261;"

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. Understanding the Decision Rule:  
   Access is granted when each prohibition is dominated by an enabling support. This means that for every prohibition (e.g., ""associate professor can't modify public data under collaboration""), there must be a corresponding support (e.g., a permission) where each element (role, view, context) is strictly preferred.

2. Analyzing the Prohibitions and Enabling Supports:  
   - Each prohibition involves a specific role, view, modification, and context.  
   - The enabling support for each prohibition provides a higher preference in role, view, or context.

3. Checking Each Prohibition:  
   - For each prohibition, identify the enabling support.  
   - Ensure that each element in the enabling support is more preferred than the corresponding element in the prohibition.

4. Applying the Preferences:  
   - Roles are ranked: full professor > associate professor > post_doc > PhD student.  
   - Views are consistent across supports.  
   - Context preferences: audit > collaboration, secondment > collaboration.

5. Conclusion:  
   Since all prohibitions have enabling supports with strictly preferred elements according to the given preferences, the access is permitted for Amelia King to perform the edit on deliverable 1.";0.473582288953993;0.075164794921875;0.06911383734809028;0.8896484375;0.9462890625;0.6123046875;0.9668508287292817;15.98;14.3;12.3;14.7;16.23;14.9

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Decision Rule:**
   - Access is granted when each prohibition is dominated by a corresponding permission.
   - Dominance requires that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to the corresponding element of the prohibition's support.

2. **Analyzing Each Support Pair:**
   - **Support 1:**
     - **Permission:** University1 grants `full_professor` to modify `WP4` with `context audit`.
     - **Prohibition:** University1 prohibits `associate_professor` from modifying `public_data` with `context collaboration`.
     - **Preferences:** `full_professor > associate Professor` and `audit > collaboration`. Thus, the permission dominates the prohibition.
   
   - **Supports 2 and 3:** Similar analysis shows that in both cases, the permissions (with `full_professor`) dominate the prohibitions (with `associate Professor` and `PhD_student` respectively), with `audit > collaboration`.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since all dominances are satisfied, access is granted for `Amelia_King` to edit `deliverable1`.

**Final Answer:**

The access is granted because for each prohibition, the corresponding permission's elements (role, view, context) are strictly preferred, satisfying the dominance condition.";0.6282155354817708;0.3448537190755208;0.22615559895833334;0.98046875;0.919921875;0.330322265625;0.967948717948718;6.0;16.0;16.83;16.8;20.64;21.0

**Explanation:**

1. **Decision Rules:**  
   Access is granted if, for each support in a prohibition, a corresponding support in a permission exists where the permission's elements strictly dominate the prohibition's.

2. **Outcome:**  
   Yara Lee is granted permission to perform a grep operation on report7.

3. **Details Influencing the Decision:**  
   - **Preferences:**  
     Yara Lee's role as a Coordinator in University1 is more preferred than roles in other organizations and contexts (e.g., staff in Institute3, PhD student in University1, team leader in University2).  
     The context ""audit"" is more preferred than ""default"" in various organizational settings.  

   - **Dominance:**  
     Each element in the permissions (e.g., Coordinator in University1, Team Leader in University2) dominates the corresponding prohibitions (e.g., Staff Member in Institute3, etc.) due to higher preference levels.  

Thus, the dominance conditions are satisfied, granting access.";0.7272501627604167;0.3879801432291667;0.3582560221354167;0.98583984375;0.97509765625;0.0709228515625;0.9461538461538461;24.64;13.0;14.18;14.3;15.12;14.6

**Explanation:**

1. **Decision Rules:**  
   Access is granted if, for each prohibition, there exists an enabling permission where each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to a corresponding element of the prohibition's support.

2. **Outcome Result:**  
   Yara_Lee is granted permission to perform `grep` on `""report7""`.

   - **Role Priorities:**  
     Yara_Lee holds the highest role of `Coordinator` in University1, which is preferred over `Team Leader` in University2 and `PhDStudent` or `StaffMember` in other contexts.  
   - **Context Preferences:**  
     The use of `audit` in University1 is preferred over `management` in University2, which in turn is preferred over `default` in Institute3.

1. **Decision Rules**: The access is granted if, for each support of prohibited access, there's a corresponding support for allowed access where each element of the allowed access's support is strictly preferred over the prohibited's.

2. **Outcomes**: Access is granted to Paul_Harry for copy on dataset6.

### Relations and Preferences:

- **Preferential Roles**:
  - **University1** employs Paul_Harry as **full_professor**, preferred over other roles like **secondee**, **post_doc**, and **staff_member**.
  - **Audit** context in **University1** is preferred over **default** and **collaboration** in other institutions.

- **Context Preferences**:
  - Audit context in **university1** is more favored than default and collaboration elsewhere.

- **Consistent Elements**:
  - Paul_Harry, copy, dataset6 are consistent across all contexts, ensuring uniformity.

### Dominance Check:

- For each prohibited support (e.g., secondee in Institute1, post_doc in University3, staff in University3), the corresponding allowed support (University1's full_professor with audit) ensures dominance.

### Conclusion:

All prohibitions are adequately supported by higher-preference permissions, thus access is granted.";0.6995361328125;0.71905517578125;0.71905517578125;0.9365234375;0.9091796875;0.7861328125;0.987012987012987;21.5;14.2;13.63;14.6;19.72;20.8

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.";2375;548;"

**1. Decision Rules**:  
The access will be granted if, for every support in the prohibition list, there exists a supporting element in the permission list that is strictly preferred. This means that for each element in the prohibited activity, there must be a corresponding element in the permitted activity that is preferred in both role and context.

**2. Outcomes**:  
Wendy-Mitchell has been granted access to perform the action ""cat"" on the dataset ""dataset7"".

---

**3. Relations And Preferences**:

a. **Role Preferences**:  
   - The preferred order of roles is: Coordinator > Post_doc < Secondee < Associate_Professor.  
   - This hierarchy determines the priority of roles when evaluating permissions and prohibitions.

b. **Context Preferences**:  
   The preferred order of contexts is: Secondment > Management > Collaboration >Default.  
   - Contexts are ranked based on their preference, influencing the evaluation of whether an action is permissible.

c. **Element Preferences**:  
   For each specific element in the prohibition supports, there is a corresponding preferred element in the permission supports. For example:  
   - The role ""Coordinator"" is preferred over ""Post_doc"", ""Secondee"", and ""Associate_Professor"".  
   - The context ""Secondment"" is preferred over both ""Management"" and ""Collaboration"", which in turn are preferred over ""Default"".

d. **Dominance Verification**:  
   Each element in the permutation of the permission supports is checked to ensure that it is strictly preferred to its counterpart in the prohibition supports. This ensures that the action can be carried out without any hindrance from prohibited elements.

e. **Priority Selection**:  
   The highest-priority role and context are selected to maximize the likelihood of the action being allowed. This selection is made by comparing the preferred elements across all supports.

f. **Conditions Met**:  
   All the required dominances have been verified, which means that for every prohibited element, there is a permitted element that is strictly preferred, thus satisfying the decision rule.

---

**Explanation of the Decision-Making Process**:

1. The decision rule is based on the principle that access is granted only when all prohibited elements are dominated by permitted elements.  
2. The highest preferred role (""Coordinator"") and context (""Secondment"") are chosen to ensure the highest level of preference is met.  
3. Each element in the prohibits list is matched with a preferred element in the permits list, ensuring that no prohibited action is allowed.  
4. By verifying the dominance of each element, the decision is made that Wendy-Mitchell can perform the action ""on dataset7"" without any restrictions.";0.6252197265625;0.330596923828125;0.246795654296875;0.94091796875;0.85400390625;0.2462158203125;0.9770992366412213;27.72;13.9;12.59;15.5;14.61;15.6

**3. Relationships and Preferences**:

### a. Role Preferences Hierarchy:  
The hierarchy of roles, from highest to lowest priority, is as follows:  
1. **Coordinator**  
2. **Post_doc** and **Secondee** (equal priority)  
3. **Associate_Professor**  

### b. Context Preferences Hierarchy:   
The hierarchy of contexts, from highest to lower priority, is:  
- **Secondment**  
- **Management** and **Collaboration** (equal preference)  
- **Default**  

### c. Element Comparisons:  
- **Role Comparison**:  
  - **Coordinator** (prohibition) is preferred to **Post_doc**, **Secondee**, and **Associate_Profector** (prohibition).  
  - **Post_doc** is preferred to **Secondee**(prohibition) and ** Associate_Professor** (prohibition)?  
  - **Secondee**
  
- **Context Comparison**:  
  Similar to the role comparison, each context in the prohibition is evaluated against the corresponding context in the permission.  

### d. Dominance Check:  
- Each element in the **prohibited action** is matched with a **preferred element** in the **permitted action**.  
  - For example, the **context ""Secondment""** in the prohibition is dominated by the **context ""Default""** in the permission.  
  - Similarly, the **role ""Coordinator""** is preferred to the **role ""Post_doc""**, **""Secondee""**, and **""Associate_Professor""**.  

### e. Highest Priority Selection:  
- The **highest priority role** is **""Coordinator""**, and the **highest priority context** is **""Secondment""**.  
- These selections ensure that the action is granted with the highest possible preference.  

### f. Matched Elements:  
- **Roles**:

The decision to grant Wendy_Mitchell access to perform the action ""cat"" on the object ""dataset7"" is based on the following structured reasoning:

1. **Access Granting Conditions**:  
   Access is granted when each element in the prohibition's support is dominated by a corresponding element in the permission's support. This means every prohibited action must be strictly preferred by a permitted action.

2. **Outcome Summary**:  
   Wendy_Mitchell now has permission to execute the ""cat"" action on ""dataset7.""

3. **Detailed Relationships and Preferences**:
   
   a. **Role Hierarchy**:  
      The roles are prioritized as follows: Coordinator is the highest, followed by Post_doc and Secondee (with equal priority), and then Associate_Professor as the lowest.

   b. **Context Hierarchy**:  
       Contexts are ranked with Secondment being the highest, followed equally by Management and Collaboration, and then Default as the lowest priority.

   c. **Element Comparisons**:
      - **Roles**: The highest-priority role, Coordinator, is matched with itself in the permission list. Lower-priority roles like Post_doc, Se condee, and Associate Professor are also matched with their respective counterparts.
      - **Contexts**: The highest context, Secondment, is matched with Default in the permission. Management and Collaboration contexts are matched with themselves, and Default is matched with Default.

   d. **Dominance Check**:  
      Each element in the prohibition list is matched with a higher-priority element in the permission list, ensuring dominance.

   e. **Highest Priority Selection**:  
      The highest-priority elements, Coordinator and Secondment, are selected to grant access, ensuring the highest possible preference is utilized.

   f. **Matched Elements**:  
      All prohibited elements find their corresponding preferred elements in the permission, facilitating the access decision.

   g. **Conclusion**:  
      By prioritizing the highest available roles and contexts, Wendy_Mitchell’s access is granted, allowing her to perform the specified action on the dataset.";0.5537823486328125;0.170086669921875;0.1205535888671875;0.953125;0.94580078125;0.420654296875;0.9379562043795621;27.72;13.9;13.71;16.0;16.64;17.5

Access is granted if, for each permission's support, there exists a prohibition's support where the permission's elements are strictly preferred to the prohibition's.

2. **Result:**  
Vega_Clark is granted the permission to sign dataset1.

---

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

- **Permitted Actions:**  
  - University2 allows Vega_Clark to validate WP5 with 'team_leader' role and 'audit' context.  
  - Institute1 permits Vega_Clark for WP1 with 'coordinator' role and 'secondment' context.

- **Prohibited Actions:**  
  Only Institute1 prohibits Vega_Clark from accessing confidential_data with 'associate_professor' role and 'default' context.

- *Comparisons:*  
  - 'Audit'(University2) > 'Default'(Institute1)  
  - 'Coordinating'(Institute1)'s role > 'Associate Professor'  
  - WP5 > WP1 > confidential_data

- **Dominance:**  
  Each permitted action's elements (roles, contexts, actions) are more preferred than the prohibited ones, hence access is granted.";0.731280517578125;0.4847412109375;0.472198486328125;0.94970703125;0.89501953125;0.145263671875;0.925;2.75;17.3;15.76;16.9;22.68;24.5

**Explanation:**

**1. Decision Rule:**  
The access is granted if, for each support within the prohibition, there is a corresponding support within the permission where the permutation's support strictly dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance occurs when each element in the permutation's support is preferred over at least an element in the prohibition’s support.

**2. Outcome:**  
The decision outcome is that Chloe Walker is granted access to edit report2.

**3. Relations and Preconditions:**

- **Context Preferences:**  
  - ""Context management"" in Institute3 and ""context secondment"" in Institute3 are preferred over ""context default"" in University1.

- **Role Preferences:**  
  1. **Institute3 (full_professor):** Full professor is preferred over PhD student.
  2. **Institute1 (coordinator):** Coordinator role is preferred over PhD Student.

 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.";2132;281;"

**1. Decision Rule:**  
Access is allowed if, for every prohibition, there exists an overlapping support where each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred over the corresponding element of the prohibition's support. This dominance is evaluated based on hierarchical preferences for roles and contexts.

**2. Outcome:**  
Ursula-Carter is granted permission to perform ""cat,"" specifically ""report6.""

**3. Relations and Preferences:**

- **Role Preferences (from highest to lowest):**
  - full_professor (Institute2)
  - team_leader (University2)
  - associate_professor (Institutes1)
  - secondee (University3)

- **Context Preferences (in order of preference):**
  - audit (highest)
  - management
  - collaboration
  - default (lowest)

- **Specific Context Domination:**
  - In Institute2: Audit context dominates collaboration and default.
  - In University2: Audit and default contexts dominate collaboration.
  - In Institute1: Audit and management contexts dominate collaboration and default.

- **Dominance Analysis:**
  - The highest role (full_professor) in Institute2 and the highest context (audit) in multiple organizations ensure the dominance of permission over prohibition.

**4. Conclusion:**  
The combination of the highest role and context preferences ensures that the necessary conditions for access are met.";0.7838792588975695;0.794921875;0.6723259819878472;0.9775390625;0.9482421875;0.4736328125;0.9712643678160919;0.62;18.1;17.03;18.1;20.77;22.4

The decision to grant access to Quinn_Thomas involves ensuring that each prohibition is dominated by its corresponding permission based on specific preferences and dominance conditions.

1. **Dominance Conditions**:
   - **Prefer Roles**: Researcher is preferred over PhDStudent, TeamLeader over PhDStudent, and AssociateProfessor over PhDStudent.
   - **Context Management**: Managing context is preferred over using default settings.
   - **Action Types**: Using report6 is preferable over signing, and managing contexts is better than default handling.

2. **Application of Preferences**:
   - In each organization (Institute3, Institute2, University1), the permissible actions (using report6, managing context, holding roles) are preferred over the prohibited ones (signing, default settings, lower roles).

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Since all prohibited activities are dominated by permissible actions, Quinn_Thomas is granted access to sign on report6.";0.6509333292643229;0.477996826171875;0.43755849202473956;0.96337890625;0.63818359375;0.262451171875;0.9426229508196722;9.38;16.8;16.69;17.1;20.19;21.2

The decision to grant Quinn_Thomas access is based on the dominance of permissible actions over prohibitions, considering the established preferences.

1. **Access Granting Conditions**:
   Access is granted when each prohibition is dominated-by a corresponding permission, evaluated using the defined preferences.

2. $$\text{Dominance Analysis}$$:
   - **Roles**: Higher-preferred roles (researcher >team_leader >PhDStudent, etc.) dominate lower ones.
   - **Actions**: Using report6 and managing contexts are preferred over signing and default settings.

3. $$\text{Treatment of Each Organization}$$:
    - **Institute3**:
      - Permissible (researcher) dominates prohibited (PhDStudent).
      - Uses report6 (preferred) over sign.
      - Manages context (preferred) over default.
    - **Istitute2**:
      - Team_leader (preferred) dominates PhDStudent.
      - Use of report6 and context management applies.
    - **University1**:
      - Higher roles dominate lower ones.

4. $$\boxed{\text{Conclusion}}$$:
   Since all prohibitions are effectively dominated by their respective permissible actions, Quinn_Tomas is granted the access.";0.6289042154947916;0.55987548828125;0.4445088704427083;0.857421875;0.9033203125;0.62060546875;0.9328358208955224;10.26;14.4;14.2;14.1;21.03;20.0

   - **Dominance Check**:
     - Each permitted action's support elements are strictly preferred to the prohibited's.
     - However, the dominance does not hold for all required prohibited actions, hence access is denied.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again. Maybe I need to break it down step by step.
Okay, so I need to figure out whether access is granted or denied based on the given logic. Let me start by understanding the overall condition for granting access. It says that access is granted if, for each support (prohibition), there exists a corresponding permutation (permission) where the permutation's support strictly dominates the prohibition's.

First, I need to list out all the supports for both permissions and prohibitions. Then, for each prohibition, I have to check if there's a corresponding permission where each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to the corresponding element in the prohibition's support.

Looking at the provided data:

**Supports of Permission:**
- Support 1: University1 grants Quinn_Thomas the right to modify secondment_agreement using report3, with context audit. The elements are:
  - University1, role team_leader, action modify, object secondment_agreement
  - Context: audit holds between Quinn_T, drop, report3 in University1.

- Support 2: Institute1 grants Quinn_T the right to modify WP5 using report3, context audit. Elements:
  - Institute1, role coordinator, action modify, obj WP5
  - Context audit holds between Quinn_t, drop, report03 in Institute1.

**Supports of Prohibitions:**
- Support1: University3 prohibits Quinn_T from modifying WP4 using report3 with context collaboration.
  - Elements:
    - University3, role post_doc, action modify, obj WP4
    - Context: collaboration holds between Quinn_T、drop、report3 in University3.

- Support2: Another place (maybe another university) prohibits modifying another view, but the details are not fully provided. Let's assume it's another support with similar elements but different context.

Now, the decision rule is that for each prohibition, there must be a permission where each element in the permission's support dominantly supports the prohibition's.

What does ""strictly preferred"" mean here? It probably means that each element in the permutation's support is more preferred than the corresponding element in prohibition's support.

From the preferences given:

- The role team_leader is preferred over post_doc.
- The role coordinator is preferred over both team_leader and post_doc.
- Context audit is preferred over context collaboration.

So, the hierarchy is:
Roles: Coordinator > Team-Leader > Post-Document
Contexts: Audit (preferred) > Collaboration

Now, let's check each prohibition.

**First Prohibition (University3, Post-Document):**
- Prohibits modifying report3 in the context of collaboration.

Is there a corresponding permission where the support's elements are strictly preferred?

Looking at the permissions:

- University1's permission is team_leader, which is higher than post_doc.
- Institute1's permission is coordinator, which is even higher than team_leader.

So, for the first prohibition (post_doc in University3), the corresponding permission could be either team_leader (University1) or coordinator (Institute1).

But wait, the dominance requires that each element of the permutation's support dominates the corresponding element of the prohibition's.

Let me think in terms of the elements:

Each element in the permutation (permission) must be strictly preferred to the element in the prohibition.

For the first prohibition (University3, post_doc, report3, collaboration context):

- The elements are: University3, role=Post_doc, action=modify, object=WP4, context=collaboration.

We need to find a permission where:

- The role is more preferred than Post_doc. So, possible roles are Coordinator or Team-Leader.

- The object (view) should be the same? Or can it be different? Wait, the objects in the permissions are secondment_agreement and WP5, which are different from WP4 and WP5. Hmm, maybe the object doesn't have to be the same, but the action is modify on the view, so the object is the view.

Wait, perhaps the 'view' is the same? No, in the permissions, the objects are different: secondment_agreement vs. WP5. In the prohibitions, the objects are WP4 and possibly another view.

This might complicate things because the objects are different. But the dominance is about the elements, not necessarily the same object.

Wait, no, the dominance is about each element of the permited support being strictly preferred to the respective element of the prohibition support.

So, for each element in the permited support, it must be strictly preferred in the corresponding position.

But the elements include the organization, role, action, object, and context.

So, to compare, we need to see if each element in the permit support is strictly preferred in the same position as the prohibition's.

But the problem is that the elements are different. For example, the first prohibition is about University3, while the permissions are about University1 and Institute1.

Similarly, the roles are different: post_doc, team_leader, coordinator.

Contexts are collaboration vs. audit.

So, to check dominance, we need to pair each element of the permit's support with the prohibition's support and see if each is strictly preferred.

But the elements don't directly correspond unless they are the same.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the dominance is only considering the roles and contexts, not the entire element set.

Alternatively, perhaps the dominance is checked per element across the same attributes.

Wait, the dominance is defined as each element of thepermited support is strictly preferred. So, for each attribute (organization, role, object, context), the permited's attribute is strictly preferred.

Wait, that might not make sense because the attributes are different.

Alternatively, perhaps it's considering the entire tuple as an element, but that seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the dominance is checked for the roles and contexts separately.

But the definition says: ""each element of the support... is strictly preferred to..."" So, for each element (i.e., each part of the support), the permited element is strictly preferred.

So, for example, if the permited support has a role that is higher than the prohibited's, and the context is higher, then it's dominant.

But since the elements are different, how do we compare them?

Wait, perhaps the key is that the permited support's elements are from a higher preference level than the prohibited's.

Given the hierarchy:

Roles: Coordinator (1) > Team-Leader (2) > Post-Document (3)

Contexts: Audit(1) > Collaboration(2)

So, for each prohibited element, we need a permited element where the permited's role is higher, and the permited's context is higher.

But the prohibited's elements may not have the same role or context as the permited's.

Wait, maybe the dominance is considered across the same attribute. For example, for the role, the permited's job must be higher than the prohibited; for the context, permited's context must be higher.

But the other attributes (organization, object) don't have a preference hierarchy, so perhaps they don't affect the dominance.

Alternatively, perhaps only the role and context are considered for dominance, and the other attributes can be ignored.

But the original definition says ""each element"" of the permited's support must be ""strictly preferred to"" the prohibited's. So, all elements must be strictly preferred.

But in this case, the permited and prohibited have different elements, so how can we compare?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the ""element"" here. Maybe each element refers to the entire tuple, not individual attributes.

But that seems too broad. Alternatively";0.745703125;0.7216796875;0.6480712890625;0.61962890625;0.89111328125;0.1519775390625;0.9762470308788599;40.55;11.0;8.04;13.6;14.49;13.3

   - **Dominance Check:**
      - Since the elements in both the permission and prohibition supports are identical, there is no element in the permission's support that is strictly preferable to any in the prohibition's support.

**Explanation:**

**Decision Rules:** Access to an action is granted if, and only if, for each element in the support of a Prohibition, there exists a supporting element in the support for a Permission such that the Permission's element is strictly preferable to the Prohibition's element. This means that each element in the Permission's support must have a clear preference over at least one element in the Prohibition's support.

**Outcomes:** Victor T. Turner does not have permission to perform the ""describe"" action on ""report5"".

**Relationships and Preferences Influencing the Decision:**
1. **Prohibitions and Permissions Supports:**
   - Both the Prohibitions and Permissions supports consist of the following elements:
     - **Organization:** University 1, University 2, and University 3.
     - **Role:** PhD_student, associate professor, and post_doc.
     - **View:** public_data and view data.
     - **Context Collaboration:** Involving Victor T. Turner.
     - **Use of report5:** Used in the context of the collaboration.

2. **Strict Preferability:**
   - For each element in the Permitted action's support, there must be a corresponding element in the Prohibited action's support that it is strictly preferable to.
   - However, in this case, the elements in the Permission's and Prohibition's supports are identical. There is no instance where an element from the Permission's support can be strictly preferable to an element in the Proihilation's support.

3. **Lack of Strict Preferability:**
    - Since all elements in both the Permission and Prohibition supports are the same, there is no dominance relationship established between the elements.
    - Without a dominance relationship, the necessary condition for granting access is not met.

**Conclusion:** The absence of a dominance relationship between the elements of the Permission and Proihilation supports results in the denial of Victor T. Turner's access to perform the specified action on report5.";0.92120361328125;0.8662109375;0.8662109375;0.97021484375;0.9658203125;0.06243896484375;0.965034965034965;29.65;13.1;12.13;15.2;14.56;14.9

1. **DecisionRule**: The access is allowed if, for each prohibition's support, there exists a permutation's support where each element of the permutation's support is strictly more preferred than the corresponding element in the prohibition's support. This is known as dominance, where each element in the permutation's support strictly dominates the corresponding element in its respective prohibition's support.

    - **DominanceDefinition**: Each element in the permutation’s support is strictly preferred over the corresponding element in each element of the prohibition’s support.

    - Therefore, the decision rule is that the access is granted if for every support in the prohibited activities, there is a corresponding support in permitted activities that dominates it.

2. **Outcomes**:
    - Nathan_White is granted the permission to perform the activity ""list"" on ""deliverable1"" because the dominance conditions for both prohibitions are satisfied.

3. **Relationships and Preferences**:
    - **First Prohibition Support (Institute2)**:
        - **Role**: Associate Professor
        - **View**: Internal Data
        - **Context**: Collaboration
        - **Permitting Support**: Institute2's wp_leader role, Secondment Agreement, Context: Secondment
        - **Explanation**: The wp_leader role is preferred over the associate professor role, and the secondment context is preferred over the collaboration context, thus dominating the first prohibition support.
    - **Second Prohibition_support (Institute3)**:
        - Role: Staff Member
        - View: Contracts
        - Context: Default
        - Permitting Support: University3's full professor role, Consult WP5, Context: Audit
        - Explanation: The full professor role is preferred over staff member, and the audit context is preferred over default, thus dominating the second prohibition support.

Thus, the access for Nathan_White performing ""list"" on delivering ""1"" is granted due to the dominance of the permissible supports over the prohibited ones.";0.7559967041015625;0.9410400390625;0.6472930908203125;0.95263671875;0.70947265625;0.470458984375;0.9735849056603774;5.87;20.2;19.08;20.3;19.16;25.7

**1. Decision Rule**:  
The access is granted based on the dominance condition. For each support in the prohibition, there must exist a corresponding support in the permission where every element in the permission's support strictly prefers at least one element from the prohibition's support.  

**2. Outcomes**:  
The decision outcome is that Chloe Walker is granted permission to perform the action ""drop"" on ""dataset1"".  

**3. Step-by-Step Explanation**:  

a. **Identify Supports**:  
   - **Prohibition Supports**:  
     - Support 1: University1, role associate_professor; context collaboration.  
     - Support X: University1, same as above but with context audit.  
     - Another support not detailed here.  
   - **Permission Supports**:  
     Each support for the permission is associated with a specific role and context.  

b. **Find Corresponding Supports**:  
   For each prohibition support (e.g., university1 with associate_professor and collaboration context), identify the corresponding permission support (e,g., university1 with researcher role and audit context).  

c. **Check Dominance**:  
   Compare each element in the permission support to the prohibition support. For example:  
   - ""The organization University1 employs Chloe Walker in the role researcher"" is preferred over ""associate_professor"" because researcher > associate_professor.  
   - The context audit is preferred over collaboration because audit > collaboration.

**1. Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if, for every support of a prohibited activity, there exists a supporting support for a permitted activity where the permitted activity's support dominates the prohibited activity's support. Dominance is defined as each element of the permitted activity's basis being strictly preferred to at minimum one element of the prohibited activity's basis.

**1. Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if, for every support of a Prohibition, there exists a supporting Prohibition where the support of the Permission dominates the support of the Prohibition. Dominance is defined as each element of the Permission's support being strictly preferred over at least one element in the Prohibition's support.

**2. Outcome:**  
The decision outcome is that the access is denied. Specifically, the Permission to sign report5 by Olivia_Scott is not granted because the required dominance conditions are not met.

**3. Relations and Preconditions:**  
- **Dominance Conditions:**  
  For each Prohibition, the Permission's support must dominate the Prohibition's. This requires each element in the Permission's support to have a strict preference over an element in the Proihilation's support.  
  - Olivia_Scott is part of the support for both Permissions and Prohibitions in each case.  
  - report5 and sign are consistently included in the Supports of Permissions and Probinations respectively across all cases.  
  - The context collaboration involving Olivia_Scott, report5, and sign is present in all scenarios.  

**Explanation of the Decision-Making Process:**  
1. **Analysis of Each Prohibition:**  
   - Each Prohibition is associated with a specific role and view (WP4, public_data, WP1).  
   - The same elements (Olivia_Scott, report6, sign) are involved in each case, indicating a recurring pattern.  

2. **Comparison of Supports:**  
   - The Permission's support includes Olivia_Scott and report5.  
   - The Prohibition's support includes OliviaScott, sign, and another element.  
   - In each case, Olivia_Scott is present in both the Permission and Prohibition supports.  

3. **Violation of Dominance:**  
   - For each Proihilation, Olivia_Scott (a member of the Prohibition support) is also a member of the Permission support.  
   - This creates a situation where the elements of the Prohibition and Permission supports overlap, preventing the Permission's support from strictly dominating the Proihilation's.  

4. **Conclusion:**

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Decision Rule:**
   - Access is granted only if, for every Prohibition, there's a corresponding Permission where the Permission's support strictly dominates the Prohibition's.
   - Dominance means every element in the Permission’s support has a strict preference over at least one in the Prohibition’s support.

2. **Analyzing Each Case:**
   - **Case 1 (Institute1):** 
     - Prohibition: Olivia_Scott, Sign, Report5
     - Permission: Olivia_Scott and Report5
   - Similarly, **Case 2 (University1)** and **Case 3 (Institute3)** follow the same pattern.

3. **Checking Dominance:**
   - For each case, Olivia-S cott is in both supports.
   - Thus, her presence in both means the Permission's elements aren't strictly dominating the Prohibition's.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since Olivia_Scott is in both supports in all cases, the dominance condition isn't met.
   - Hence, access is denied.

**Final Answer:**

The access is denied because Olivia_Scott is a member of both the Permission's and Prohibition's support in each case. This overlap prevents the Permission's elements from strictly dominating those of the Prohibition, violating the necessary conditions.";0.620550537109375;0.106689453125;0.106689453125;0.97021484375;0.97119140625;0.052032470703125;0.9702380952380952;30.06;13.0;13.66;15.2;15.95;16.7

**2. Outcomes:**
Amelia_King has been granted permission to read dataset1.

**Details of the Relationships and Preferences Leading to the Decision:**

- **Researcher in Institute2:**
  - Strictly preferred over PhD_student across both contexts (default and collaboration).
  - Dominates both prohibition supports due to being preferred over PhD_student and having a better context (secondment > default and collaboration).

- **Full_professor in Institution1:**
  - Dominates the first prohibition (default context) as Full_professor > PhdStudent.
  - Also dominates the second prohibition (collaboration context) since Full_professor is still preferred over PhdStudent.

- **Secondee in University₃:**
  - Dominate both prohibitions as Secondee > PhdStudent in both contexts.

**Context Preferences:**
- Secondment context is preferred over both default and collaboration contexts.
- Management context in Institution1 is preferred over default.

### 1. Decision Rule:
The access is granted if for each support of the prohibition, there's a corresponding support in permission where each element of the permutation in the permission is preferred over the respective element in the prohibition.

### 2. Outcome:
Access is granted for Chloe Walker to edit report3 in Institute2.

### 3. Reasons:
- **Permutations and Preferences:**
  - **Team Leader vs. Secondee:** Team leader in Institute2 is more preferred than secondee in University3.
  - **Context Management vs. Default:** Management in Institute2 is preferable to default in both University3 and Institute2.

### 1. **Conditions for Granting Access**
Access is granted if for each permission support there exists a corresponding prohibition support where the permission's role and context are strictly preferred to the prohibition's.

### 2a. **Permission Supports**
1. **Role:** `full_professor`
   - **Contexts:** `audit`
   - **Prefered to:** `associate_professor` and `secondment_agreement`
   - **Preferred Contexts:** `audit` is preferred over `collaboration` and `default`

2. **Role:** `[wp_leader]`
   - **Priorities:** `wp_leader` is preferred over both `associate_profector` and `staffMember`
   - **Priority Contexts:** `secondment` is preferred over any other context

### 2b. **Prohibition Supports**
1. Support 0:
   - Role: `associate_profector`
   - Context: `collaboration`
2. Support 1: 
   - Role: `[staffMember]`
   - Contexts: `default`

### 3. **Comparisons**
- **Roles:**
  - `full_professor` > `associate_profector`, `wp_leader`, `staffMember`
  - `wp_leader` > `staffMember`, `associate_profector`

- **Contexts:**
  - For each role, `secondment` and `audit` contexts are preferred over `default` and `collaboration`

### 4. **Conclusion**
All preferred roles and their contexts for permissions dominate the prohibitions, thus access is granted.

**Final Answer:**

The access is granted because the preferred roles (`full_professor`, `wp_leader`) and their respective contexts (`audit`, `secondment`) dominate the prohibited roles (`associate_profector` with `collaboration`, `staffMember` with `default`).";0.5567108154296875;0.6923828125;0.4913177490234375;0.400146484375;0.9375;0.73779296875;0.9171270718232044;12.94;15.4;11.65;13.8;22.04;24.9

**Explanation:**

1. **The decision rule is:**
   Access is granted if, for every support in the set of prohibitions, there exists a supporting element in the set of permissions such that the permission's support strictly dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance is defined as each element in the permission's support being strictly preferred to at lease one element in the corresponding prohibition's support.

---

2. **The outcome is:**
   The permission for Eva_Clarke to perform the action ""sign"" on ""report4"" is granted. This is because the dominance condition has been satisfied.

3. **The relations and preferences that led to the decision:**
   - **Elements of the Permission's Support:**
     - Eva_Clark
     - report4
     - The context secondment
   - **Dominance Relationships:**
     - **Vega_Clark is strictly preferable to ""sign"":** Eva_Clark has the capability to perform the ""sign"" action, indicating a higher preference or capability.
     - **The context secondment is strictly preferable to the secondment holds:** The context secondment implies that the secondment holds, establishing a dominance relationship.
   - **Conclusion from Preferences:**
     - Since each element in the permutation's support is strictly preferable to at least one aspect of the prohibition's support, the dominance condition is fulfilled, leading to the permission being granted.";0.612579345703125;0.061187744140625;0.061187744140625;0.98388671875;0.97265625;0.016021728515625;0.9897959183673469;19.3;17.1;16.61;18.5;16.13;21.0

1. **Correct Decision Rule:**  
The access is granted when, for every element in the prohibition’s support set, there exists an element in the permission’s support set that is strictly preferred. This ensures that the permission can be executed without violating any prohibitions.

2. **Final Outcome:**  
The decision to grant Eva_Clark the permission to sign '報告4' is valid.

3. **Details Behind the Decision:**  
- Eva_Cla克 has demonstrated the necessary capability to perform the signing action, which is essential for her assigned secondment. This shows that her skills meet the required standards for the role.  
- The specific validation of '報告4' within the designated secondment context aligns perfectly with Eva_Cla克's responsibilities, reinforcing the security posture.  
- By meeting these conditions, Eva_Cla克’s actions are deemed appropriate and permissible, ensuring that her contributions are aligned with organizational requirements.  
- The integration of her role with the secondment structure demonstrates that her capabilities are sufficiently superior to the prohibited actions in this context, thus justifying the permission.";0.6002227783203125;0.06939697265625;0.06939697265625;0.93603515625;0.939453125;0.0131683349609375;0.9634146341463414;25.9;14.6;17.02;16.5;16.94;17.9

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted when each permission's support fully dominates its corresponding prohibition. This means that for every element in the permission, there is a strictly preferred element in the corresponding prohibition.

**Outcome:**  
The access is granted for ""Katherine_Moore"" to validate ""dataset10"".

**Relations and Preferences Leading to the Decision:**

- **University2's Researcher Permission:**  
  - **Element Comparison:**  
    - **University2** > **University3** (higher institution)  
    - **Researcher** > **PhD_student** (higher role)  
    - Both contexts (secondment vs. collaboration) are strictly preferred.  
  - **Conclusion:** This permission dominates the corresponding prohibition, allowing access.

- **University1's Full Professor Permission:**  
  Similarly, the higher hierarchy and role (full professor vs. PhD student) along with the management context over collaboration ensure dominance.

- **University3's Coordinator Permission:**  
  The higher role (coordinator) and management context again ensure dominance over the corresponding prohibition.

**Detailed Explanation:**

1. **Comparisons Between Permissions and Prohibitions:**
   - **University2 Researcher vs. University3 PhD Student:**
     - **Institution:** University2 > University3
     - **Role:** Researcher > PhD Student
     - **Context:** Secondment > Collaboration
     - **Conclusion:** The researcher role and secondment context dominate the PhD student role and collaboration, allowing access.

   - **University1 Full Professor vs. University3 Staff Member:**
     - Higher hierarchy and role (Full Professor > PhD Student > Staff Member)
     - Context: Management > Collaboration > Default
     - Conclusion: The higher role and management context ensure dominance, granting access.

2. **Contextual Comparisons:**
   - Each context (secondment, management, collaboration, default) is evaluated for strict preference.
   - Example: Management context is preferred over collaboration, ensuring the permission's context is more favorable.

3. **Role Comparisons Across Institutions:**
   - Higher positions (Full Professor, Researcher, Coordinator) dominate lower ones (PhD Student, Staff Member, Post Doc).
   - This hierarchy ensures that each permission's role is strictly preferred over its corresponding prohibition.

**Detailed Explanation:**  

1. **Step 1: Understand the Decision Rule**  
   - The access will be granted if, for every permission support, there is a corresponding prohibition support such that each element of the permutation is strictly preferred to its corresponding element in the prohibits' support.  

2. **Step 2: Identify the Key Comparisons**  
   - We need to compare the elements of the permissions with the corresponding elements of the prohibitions.  

3. **Step 3: Evaluate the Preferences**  
   - **Researcher (University2)** is preferred over **PhD_Student (University3)**.  
   - **Secondment Context** is preferred over **Collaboration Context**.  
   - Higher positions like **Full_Professor (University1)** dominate lower positions like **PhD_Students (University3)**, **Staff_Members (Institute3)**, and **Post_Docs (Institute3)$.  
   - **Management Context** is the highest preference compared to **Default Context**.  

4. **Step 4: Check the Contextual Hierarchy**  
   - For each context (e.g., Management, Secondment, Collaboration, Default), the context of the permission is more preferred than the context of the prohibition.  

5. **Step 5: Apply the Dominance Rule**  
   – Each element of the permission’s support is strictly preferred over the corresponding element ofthe prohibition’s support.  

6. **Step 6: Conclude the Outcome**

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.";857;1802;"1. Decision Rule:  
   The access is granted if for each support of the prohibition, there's a corresponding support for the permission where the permission’s support dominates the prohibition’s support. Dominance means each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred over at least one element in the prohibition's support.

2. Outcome:

3. Relations and Preferences:  
   a. North Hospital:  
      - Permits Ben Foster to operate on medical_file with anestheic_patient.  
      - Prohibits medical_secretary from operating on personal_data in the morning.  
      - The preference ""nurse > medical_secretary"" and ""anestheic_patient > morning"" makes the north hospital's support dominate.  
   b. East Hospital:  
      ...  
   c. South Hospital:  
      ...
   d. Central Hospital:  
      ...

Wait, I need to think about how to structure this properly. Maybe I should break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the decision rule is. It says that access is granted if, for each support of prohibited actions, there's a support for the permitted actions where the permitted support dominates the prohibited one. Dominance is when each element in the permitted support is strictly preferred to one in the prohibited support.

Looking at the given data, there are three hospitals: north, east, and south. Each has a support for a permission and a support for a prohibition.

For each hospital, I need to check if the permission support dominates the prohibition support.

Starting with north_hospital:

- Permits: Ben_Foster can operate on medical_file using anesthetic_patient.
- Prohibits: medical_secretary can operate on personal_data during morning.

Check dominance:

- Ben_Foster is preferred over medical_secretary (as per the given preference).
- anesthetic_patient is preferred over morning.

So, each element in the permission support is strictly preferred, so dominance is satisfied.

Similarly, for east_hospital:

- permits Ben_Foster to operate on sample with intern_presc_hour.
- prohibits medical_secretary from using sample in the morning.

Check:

- intern is preferred over medicalsecretary.
- intern_presc_hour preferred over morning.

Thus, dominance holds.

South_hospital:

- prohibits Ben_Foster from using sample in personal_data during morning.
- but no permission listed? Wait, the initial problem statement says that the access is granted based on the condition that for each support of prohibition, there is a corresponding support for permission where the permission dominates the prohibition.

But in the given data, the south hospital only has a prohibition, not a permission. So, does that mean that the condition is not met? Because the condition is that for each support in the prohibition, there must be a corresponding support in the permission that dominates it.

But in the south hospital, there is a support in the prohibition but no corresponding support in the permutation. So, the condition is not satisfied, hence access is denied?

Wait, but the outcome says the permission is granted. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the decision outcome is that the permission is granted, so perhaps the condition is met across all prohibitions.

Wait, let me re-examine the problem statement.

""Access is granted if and Only if, for each Support of a prohibition, There exists a Corresponding support for a permission Where the permission's support DOMINATES the prohibition's.""

So, for every support in the prohibited action, there must be some support in the permitted action that dominates it.

In the given data, we have three hospitals:

1. North: Has a prohibition support (medical_secretary, personal_data, morning) and a permission support (Ben_Foster, medical_file, anesthetic_patient).

2. East: Same structure.

3. South: Only has a prohibition support, no permission support.

So, for the south hospital, since there is a prohibition support, but no corresponding permission support, the condition fails. Therefore, the access should be denied. But the outcome says it's granted. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the overall access is granted if the condition is met for each support across all hospitals. That is, for each support in any of the prohibitions, there is a dominating support in the corresponding permissions.

But then, the south hospital has a prohibition support without a corresponding permission support, so the condition is violated, leading to access being denied.

But the outcome says the access is granted. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Wait, the problem statement says:

""An access is granted If and Only If, for each support Of a prohibition, There Exists a Corresponding support For a permission Where the permutation's support DOMINATE the prohibition's.""

Wait, perhaps the 'each support of a prohibition' refers to each support in the set of all prohibitions, and for each such support, there is a supporting permission that dominates.

But in the data, we have:

- North has a prohibition support: medical_secretary, personal data, morning.

- East has a prohibition support similar.

- South has a different prohibition support: Ben_Foster, sample, morning.

Wait, no, the south hospital's prohibition is about Ben_Foster, using sample in personal data during morning.

So, for each of these prohibitions, we need to find a corresponding permission that dominates.

In the north hospital, the prohibition is medical_secretary performing on personal data in the morning. The corresponding permission is Ben_Foster operating on medical_file using the anesthetic_patient. Since Ben_Foster is more preferred than medical_secretary, and anesthetic_patient is more preferred than morning, the dominance holds.

Similarly, in the east hospital, the forbidden action is medical_secretary operating on sample in the morning. But wait, the east hospital's forbidden action is actually the same as the south? Wait, no.

Wait, the east hospital allows Ben_Foster to do a certain thing, but the south hospital prohibits medical_secretary doing something else.

Wait, perhaps I need to list all the prohibitions and their corresponding permissions.

Wait, perhaps the key is that for each individual support in the prohibitions across all hospitals, there is a permission support that dominates it.

So, for example:

1. North's prohibition: medical_secretary operates on personal_data in morning.

Dominance is satisfied by Ben_Foster's permission.

2. East's prohibition: same as north? Or is it different?

Wait, looking back:

In the problem statement, the supports of prohibition are:

Only for south hospital: Ben_Foster in role medical_secretary; uses sample in view personal_data; context is morning.

Wait, perhaps each hospital has both a permission and a prohibition.

Wait, north has a permission support and a prohibition support.

East has a permission support (operating on sample with intern presc hour) and a prohibition support (same as north? Or different?).

South has a prohibition support but no permission support.

Wait, the original problem statement says:

List of supports of permission:

north: Ben_Foster performs operate on medical_file, using anesthetic_patient.

east: Ben_F Fosters perform operate on sample, using intern_presc_hour.

south: Ben_Foster is prohibited from performing operate on sample in personal_data at morning.

So, in each hospital, there is either a permission or a prohibition, but not both.

Wait, that can't be, because the condition is for each support in a prohibition, there must exist a corresponding support in a permission.

So, if a hospital has a prohibition but no corresponding permission, then the condition is violated.

Therefore, the overall access is denied.

But the decision outcome says the permission was granted. So, I must have misread the problem.

Wait, perhaps all three hospitals have both a permission and prohibition? Let me check.

No, the problem statement lists:

Supports of permission:

north, east, south each have their own.

Supports of prohibition:

Only south has a prohibition.

So, in the south, there is a prohibition, but no permission. Therefore, the condition fails, so access is denied. However, the outcome says it is granted.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the initial problem says:

""Access is granted IF and ONLY IF, for each support OF a PROHIBITION, there EXISTS a Corresponding support FOR a permutation where the permutation's support dominates the PROHIBITION's support.""

So, the condition is: for every support in any of THE PROHIBITIONS, there is a permutation support that dominates.

So, in our case, we have:

From north: a prohibition support (med sec, sample, morning).

From south: another prohibition support (Ben";0.83951416015625;0.8525390625;0.67388916015625;0.9619140625;0.72021484375;0.010986328125;0.9764795144157815;41.16;10.8;7.13;13.1;13.44;12.1

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Decision Rule:**
   - Access is granted if, for each prohibition, there's an enabling permission where each element in its support is strictly preferred.

2. **Break Down the Supports:**
   - **Prohibitions:**
     1. South Hospital: Students can't consult on Medical Data at Afternoon.
     2. West Hospital: Patients can't consult on Sample at Sample Analysis.
     3. West Hospital: Externs can't consult on Admin Data at Sample Analysis.
   - **Permissible Permissions:**
     2. East Hospital: Interns can consult on Sample at Referent Doctor.
     1. East Hospital: Doctors can consult on Personal Data at Emergency.
     2a. West Hospital: externs can consult on Admin at Sample Analysis.

3. **Compare Each Prohibition with its Corresponding Permission:**

   - **First Prohibition (South Hospital):**
     - **Role Preference:** Student (South) < Doctor < Intern < extern.
     - **Context Preference:** Afternoon < Emergency < Referent Doctor < Morning.
     - **Permissible Permission (East):** Intern (East) at Referent Doctor context.
     - **Dominance:** Intern > Student, Referent Doctor > Afternoon.

   - **Second Prohibition (West Hospital - Patients):**
     - No direct corresponding permission. This prohibits access, so access should be denied.

   - **Third Prohibition (WestHospital - Externs):**
     - Permissible Permission (West): Externs can consult at Sample Analysis context.
     - However, Sample Analysis is the least preferred context, so dominance doesn't hold.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Only the first prohibition has a corresponding permission that meets the dominance criteria.
   - The second and third prohibitions do not have enabling permissions.
   - Therefore, access is **not granted**.

**Final Decision:**
Access is not granted because not all prohibitions have enabling permissions meeting the dominance condition.";0.3415827433268229;0.14811197916666666;0.11888376871744792;0.23681640625;0.82861328125;0.62451171875;0.9382239382239382;26.88;12.1;8.02;13.2;16.05;15.3

**Explanation:**

1. **Decision Rules:** The access is granted when, for each prohibition's support, a corresponding permission's support exists where each element of the latter is strictly preferred to its corresponding element in the former.

2. **Outcomes:** Access is granted for Victor Turner to sign on sample 5 due to meeting the dominance criteria.

3. **Relationships:**
   - **Relation 1:** West Hospital's liberal_doctor role is preferred over other roles.
   - **Context 1:** Referent_doctor context in West Hospital is preferred over morning contexts elsewhere.

4. **Preferencing:**
   - Liberal_doctor is preferred over extern and medical_secretary.
   - Referent_doctor surpasses morning and afternoon contexts.
   - West Hospital's setup is preferred over others in terms of roles and contexts.

By these factors, the dominance condition is satisfied, granting access.";0.7096272786458334;0.3275553385416667;0.313446044921875;0.9677734375;0.95654296875;0.017181396484375;0.9672131147540983;31.28;12.5;11.99;13.4;16.06;15.8

     - East Hospital (again): Student handles Personal Data with Sample Analysis.
     - South Hospital: Student handles Medical Data with Morning.

4. **Preference Hierarchy:**
   - Roles: Hospital Doctor > Liberal Doctor > Student > Extern.
   - Contexts: Anesthetic Patient > Referent Doctor > Sample Analysis > Morning > No Anesthesia.

5. **Decision Logic:**
   - Each prohibition is matched with a permit where every element is strictly preferred.
   - Example: Extern < Hospital Doctor and No Anesthesia < Anesthetic Patient.

**Conclusion:** The access is granted because each prohibition is supported by a more dominant permission, ensuring Charlie_Brown can perform the delegate action.";0.5225499471028646;0.06592814127604167;0.06024932861328125;0.9541015625;0.9365234375;0.404052734375;0.9037433155080214;16.18;14.2;11.63;14.6;17.44;16.7

**Explanation:**

**1. Decision Rule:**  
The access is granted if, for each prohibition, there is a corresponding permission where every element of the permission's support is strictly preferred over the prohibition's support.

**2. Outcome:**  
Charlie_Brown is granted permission to perform the delegate action on ""patinate\_medical\_data"".

**3. Relations and Preferences:**

- **Permits and Prohibitions:**
  - **Permit 1 (East Hospital):**  
    - Role: Hospital Doctor  
    - Activity: Handle on Medical Data  
    - Context: Anesthetic Patient  
  - **Prohibition 1 (West Hospital):**  
      - Role: Extern  
      - Context: No Anesthesia  
  - **Peritmit 2 (North Hospital):**

1. **DecisionRule:**  
   The decision is based on the principle that each Prohibition must have a corresponding Permission where all elements in the Permission's Support are strictly preferred over the Prohibition's. This ensures that the necessary conditions for access are met.

2. **Result:**  
   Charlie-Brown is granted access to handle 'patinate_medical_data' due to the dominance of preferred Permissions over Prohibitions.

3. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**  
   a. **Hospital Doctor (east_hospital):**  
      - **Permission:** Handle 'medical_data' using 'AnestheticPatient'.
      - **Prohibition:** NoAnesthesia in west_hospital.
      - **Preference:** AnestheticPatient > NoAnesthesia, allowing access.

   b. **Liberal Doctor & Student (north_hospital and east/south_hospital):**
      - **Permissions:** Handle 'sample_data' and 'personal_data'.
      - **Preferenced Contexts:** ReferentDoctor, SampleAnalysis, morning.
      - **Access:** Enabled by higher-preference contexts.

   c. **All Prohibitions are Covered:**  
      Each Prohibition has a more preferred Permission, ensuring no access is denied.

4. **Final Decision:**  
   Access to handle 'patiate_medical_data' is granted for Charlie-Brown.";0.4307079315185547;0.086517333984375;0.07922935485839844;0.763671875;0.95361328125;0.7294921875;0.8394160583941606;9.75;14.6;15.17;14.2;21.61;20.9

**Explanation:**

---

1. **DecisionRule:**
   - **Access is granted** if, for each **permission's support**, there exists a corresponding **prohibition's support** where each element of the permission's support is **strictly preferred** to the corresponding element of the prohibition's support. This is known as **dominance**. 

2. **Outcome:** 
   - **Vega_Clark is granted access** to perform the operation ""aOperate"" on ""patinate_admin_data_1"".

3. **Details:** 
   - The decision is based on three specific contexts: **emergency**, **sample_analysis**, and **referent_doctor**. 
   - In each context, the **permitted role (doctor)** is strictly preferred over the **prohibited role (medical_secretary)**. 

4. **Verification:**
   - Across all three contexts, the dominance condition is satisfied. For example:
     - In the **emergency context**, Eva_Clark's role as a **doctor** is preferred over being a **medical_secretary**.
     - Similarly, in the **sample_analysis** and **referent.doctor** contexts, the same preference applies.

5. **Consequence:**
   - Since all required dominance conditions are met, Eva_Clark's access is granted.

**1. Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if, for every support of a prohibited activity, there exists a supporting support for a permitted activity where the permitted activity's support dominates the prohibited activity's support. Dominance is defined when each element of the permitted activity's domain is strictly preferred to an element of the prohibited activity's domain.

**1. Decision Rules:**  
Access is determined by ensuring that for each prohibition, there's a corresponding permission where the permission’s support dominates the prohibition’s support. Dominance requires each element of the permission’s support to be strictly preferred over the corresponding element of the prohibition’s support.

**2. Outcomes:**  
Henry LEE is granted permission to validate 'sign' on 'patinet_admin_data'.

**3. Relationships & Preferences:**

- **Permitted Activities:**
  - Henry LEE as a SURGEON in EAST HOSPITAL can validate 'validate' on 'prescribtion_data'.
  - As a NURSE in NORTH HOSPITAL, he can validate 'medical_data'.
  - AS an INTERN in NORTH HOSPital, he can validate medical_file.

- **Prohibited Activities:**
  Only in WEST HOSPITAL, Henry LEE is prohibited from validating 'admin_data' during MORNING.

- **Preference Comparisions:**
  - SURGEON > EXTERNAL, NURSE > EXTERNAL, INTERN > EXTERNAL.
  - REFERENT DOCTOR > MORNING, EMERGENCY > MORNING.

**Explanation of Dominance:**

For each prohibited activity (WEST HOSPITAL's external role), Henry LEE's permitted roles (SURGEON, NURSE, INTERN) and contexts (REFERENT DOCTOR, EMERGENCY) provide dominance. Each permitted element is strictly preferred over the prohibited ones, satisfying the dominance condition.

**1. Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted if, and only if, for every prohibition, there exists an enabling permission where each element of the permutation's support is strictly preferred to the corresponding element of its associated prohibition's support. This ensures that the user has the necessary permissions to perform the requested action without violating any prohibitions.

**2. Outcome:**  
Henry Lee has been granted permission to validate the ""Sign"" on ""patinate_admin_data"".

**3. Relationships and Preferences:**  

- **Permitted Roles and Contexts:**  
  - **EAST HOSPITAL:** Henry Lee is permitted as a **SURGEON** to validate ""validate"" on ""prescription_data"" within the ""REFERENT DOCTOR"" context.  
  - **NORTH HOSPITAL:** He is permitted as a both **NURSE** and **INTERN** to validate ""medical_data"" and ""medical_file"" respectively, both within the ""EMERGENCY"" context.  

- **Prohibited Role and Context:**  
  - Only in **WEST HOSPITAL**, Henry Lee is prohibited from performing the ""validate"" action on ""admin_data"" during the ""MORNING"" context.

- **Strict Preference Comparisons:**  
  - His roles are ranked as **SURGEON > NURSE > INTERN > EXTERNAL**.  
  - The contexts are ranked as **REFERENT DOCTOR > EMERGENCY >Morning**.  

**Explanation of Dominant Relationships:**  
Each of Henry Lee's permitted roles and contexts in EAST and NORTH HOSPITALs strictly dominate the single prohibited role and context in WEST HOSPTIAL. This dominance is ensured by the higher preference of his roles and contexts compared to the prohibited ones, thereby satisfying the access conditions.";0.42408243815104163;0.07421875;0.07158406575520833;0.87744140625;0.94189453125;0.8447265625;0.96;24.48;15.1;15.66;16.9;15.84;18.9

**1. DecisionRule:**  
Access is accepted if, for every prohibits, there's a corresponding enableing permission where each element in the permission's support is strictly favored over the corresponding element in the prohibition's support.

**2. Result:**  
Henry Lee is granted permission to validate ""Sign"" on “patinate_admin_data”.

**3. Details and Preferences:**

- **Permitted Permissions:**
  - **East Hospital:** Henry Lee can validate on prescription_data as a Surgeon within the REFERENT DOCTOR context.
  - **North Hospital:** He can validate on medical_data and medical_file as a Nurse and Intern, respectively, within the EMERGENCY context.

- **Prohibited Action:**
  - Only in West Hospital, Henry Lee is banned from validating on admin_data during the MORNING context.

- **Preference Rankings:**
  - Roles: SURGEON is highest, followed by NURSE, then INTERN, and finally EXTERNAL.
  - Contexts: REFERENT DOCTOR comes first, then EMERGENCY, and then MORNING.

- **Dominance Check:**
  - Each permitted action (as Surgeon, Nurse, and Intern) and their contexts are more preferred than the prohibited action in West Hospital.
  - This ensures that the permitted actions strictly dominate the prohibited one.

- **No Conflicts:**
  - There are no overlaps or conflicts between the prohibited and permitted actions.

**Conclusion:**  
Since all prohibitions are sufficiently dominated by the permitted permissions, Henry Lee is authorized to perform the required action.";0.7076151529947916;0.44384765625;0.2526753743489583;0.927734375;0.95458984375;0.040771484375;0.9567307692307693;28.13;13.7;14.05;15.9;16.3;17.5

**AI (Explanation):**

**1. Decision Rules:**  
Access is determined based on the dominance of permissions over prohibitions. For each permission, there must be a corresponding prohibition where each element of its support is strictly preferred. This involves checking the role, context, and the specific elements involved in both permissions and prohibitions.

**2. Outcomes:**  
The decision outcome is that access is granted, specifically allowing Xander Rodrigues from South Hospital to perform a biopsy on Sample 1 in the admin_data view.

**3. Relationships and Preferences:**

- **Role Preferences:**
  - **Surgeon (South Hospital)** is preferred over **Extern (North Hospital)** because the context **intern_presc-hour** is more preferable than **afternoon**.
  - **Specialist (West Hospital)** is preferred to **Medical Secretary (East Hospital)** due to the context **emergency** being more preferable than **morning**.

- **Context Comparisons:**
  - The **intern_presc-hours** context in South Hospital is more preferable than the **afternoon** context in North Hospital.
  - The **emergency** context in West Hospital is more preferable compared to the **morning** context in East Hospital.

- **Element-wise Preferences:**
  1. **Xander Rodrigues' Roles:**
     - As a **Surgeon** in South Hospital, his role is preferred over being an **Extern** in North Hospital.
     - His role as a **Specialist** in West Hospital is preferred over being a **Medical Secretary** in East Hospital.

  2. **Contextual Comparisons:**
     - The **biopsy** activity in the **sample_1** view is preferred to other activities in the respective views.
     - The **sample_1**, **biopsy**, and **view** elements are common across all supports, ensuring consistency in the comparison.

- **Dominance of Permissions:**
  - Each permission's support (e.g., roles and contexts) is dominated by a corresponding prohibition's support based on the above preferences.
  - This dominance ensures that the permissible actions are outweighed by the prohibitive ones, thus granting access.

**Conclusion:**  
By systematically comparing the roles, contexts, and elements involved, the decision is made that the permissible actions (performing a biopsy on Sample _1) are outweighed by their prohibitive counterparts, leading to the access being granted.";0.833453369140625;0.99365234375;0.720733642578125;0.9404296875;0.818359375;0.305908203125;0.9595015576323987;28.74;13.5;12.44;15.5;15.54;17.2

**Explanation:**  
Access is granted when permissions dominate prohibitions, with each permitted element strictly preferred over its corresponding prohibition.  

1. **Rules:**  
   If for every prohibition, a permission exists where each element is more preferred, access is granted.

2. **Result:**  
   The system allows Amelia_King in East Hospital to perform 'anaesthetic' on 'patinate_medical_data'.

This is because:  
- **Anesthetist** is preferred over **Patient** and **Medical Secretary**.  
- **Medical Data** is preferred over both **Sample View** and **Afternoon**.  
- The activity **Prepare Operation** is enabled by the respective permissions.  
- The context **Anesthetise** is more preferred than **Sample Analysis** or **Afternoon**, ensuring dominance.  

Thus, the access is granted due to the dominance of preferred permissions over prohibited elements.";0.7635856628417969;0.5862274169921875;0.3401298522949219;0.9853515625;0.94482421875;0.038604736328125;0.9380530973451328;23.83;13.3;14.25;14.9;17.1;17.2

**Explanation:**  
To determine whether access is granted, we need to evaluate the dominance of permissions over prohibitions based on the given rules and preferences.  

1. For each prohibition, we check if there exists a corresponding permission where all elements of the permission are strictly preferred to the elements of the prohibition.  

2. The preferred relations are as follows:  
   - **Permitted Elements:**  
     - 'Anestherist' is preferred over 'Patient' and 'Medical Secretary'. This means that in East Hospital, Amelia_King has the highest preference for being an anesthetist compared to being a patient or a medical secretary.  
     - 'MedicalData' is preferred over both 'SampleView' and 'Afternoon'. This indicates that working with medical data is more important than performing operations on sample views or during the afternoon.  

3. **Dominance Check:**  
   - For the prohibition regarding 'SampleAnalysis' in South Hospital, the corresponding permission 'Intern' in South Hospital has higher preference. This is because being an intern is preferred over being a patient.  
   - Similarly, for the prohibition regarding 'Afternoon' in East Hospital, the permission 'Anestherister' in East Hospital is preferred.  

4. **Conclusion:**  
   Since all permissions are strictly preferred over their corresponding prohibitions, the system grants access for the following actions:  
   - Amelia_King can perform the 'anaesthetic' activity on 'patiate_medical_data' in East Hospital.  
   - The 'prepare_operation' activity is allowed on 'sample view' in South Hospital for the role of 'intern'.  

Thus, access is granted for these specific permissions as they meet the dominance criteria set by the preferences.";0.670367431640625;0.78466796875;0.496856689453125;0.916015625;0.8505859375;0.6962890625;0.9462809917355371;26.2;14.5;14.14;16.8;16.01;17.1

 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.";1936;372;"

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Decision Rule:**
   - Access is granted if each allowed action (permission) has a corresponding prohibits action (prohibition), where every element in the permitted action's context is strictly preferable to the corresponding element in the prohibited action's context.

2. **Identify Permitted and Prohibited Actions:**
   - **Permitted Actions:**
     - North Hospital (Surgeon): Analyze on `medical_file` with context `Anesthesi Patient`.
     - South Hospital (Hospital Doctor): Analyze `sample` with context `Aneestic Patient`.
   - **Prohibited_actions:**
     - West Hospital (Medical Secretary): Prohibits `Personal Data` analysis with context `Morning`.
     - East Hospital (Extern): Prohibits on `Prescription Data` with context `Afternood`.

3. **Evaluate Dominance:**
   - Compare each permitted action with its corresponding prohibited action:
     - **Permit 1 (Surgeon) vs Proh 1 (Medical Secretary):**
       - Context: `Anesthesic.Patient` (permit) is preferred over `Morning` (禁止).
       - Dominance holds.
     - **Peritmit 2 (Hospital Doctor) vs Prohi 2 (Extern):**
       - `Anthesesic.Pat` > `Afternood`.
       - Dominence holds.

4. **Role Hierarchy:**
   - Roles are ranked: `Surgeon > HospitalDoctor > MedicalSecretary > Extern`.
   - Higher-ranked roles ensure their permissions take precedence.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - All permitted actions dominate their respective prohibitions.
   - Role hierarchy supports the granting of access.
   - Therefore, Olivia_Scott's access is granted.";0.5054585774739583;0.219879150390625;0.18851725260416666;0.59521484375;0.884765625;0.361083984375;0.8505154639175257;8.33;15.1;13.07;15.2;19.94;20.0

**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when each permission's support entirely dominates the corresponding prohibition's support. This means every element in the permission’s support is strictly preferred over the prohibited support's elements, considering both roles and contexts.

**Outcome**: 
Rachel_Baker is granted permission to perform the delegate function on script_1 due to meeting the dominance criteria.

**Relations and Preconditions**:

1. **Doctor in South Hospital**:
   - Handles `personal_data` with `emergency` context.
   - Dominance over `Patient` in North Hospital handling `medical_file` with `sample_analysis`:
     - `Doctor` > `Patient`
     - `personal_data` > `medical_file`
     - `emergency` > `sample_analysis`

2. **Nurse in East Hospital**:
   -
   - Handles `admin_data` with `anesthesicPatient` context.
   -

3. **Anesthetist in West Hospital**:
   -/
   - Handles `sample` with `emergency`.
   - Prohibits `patient` handling `medical_file`, `sample_analysis`.

**Conclusion**:
All permissions meet the dominance conditions, allowing Rachel_Baker's access.";0.43935699462890626;0.06237030029296875;0.0514068603515625;0.9765625;0.8623046875;0.755859375;0.9618320610687023;8.84;14.9;14.59;15.0;21.61;21.2

**Explanation:**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Dominance Condition:** For each prohibition, there must be a corresponding support for the permission where each element of the permutation's support is strictly preferable to at least one in the prohibition's.
   - **Preference Hierarchy:** Roles and contexts are preferred based on their hierarchy, e.g., doctor > extern, specialist > student, etc.

2. **Outcome:**
   - Ben_Foster is granted permission to perform blood_analysis using sample_05. This is because the support for the permission (e.g., Ben_Foster as a doctor or specialist) is preferred over the prohibitions, and the context (e.g., intern_presc_hour or sample_analysis) aligns to satisfy the dominance condition.

3. **Details and Preferences:**
   - The preferred roles (doctor, specialist, intern) dominate over less preferred roles (extern, student, patient).
   - Preferred contexts (like intern_presc_hour) dominate over others (e.g., sample_analysis, afternoon).
   - These dominances ensure that the required conditions for granting access are met.

**Conclusion:**
The access is granted because the preferred roles and contextual supports meet the dominance criteria, ensuring that the permission is granted where the required conditions are satisfied.";0.5394632975260416;0.11949666341145833;0.10174560546875;0.94921875;0.96630859375;0.439453125;0.9593023255813954;30.97;12.6;13.28;14.7;17.22;17.1

1. **DecisionRule:**  
   - The access is granted if, for each prohibition, there's a corresponding support in the permission where every element in the permission's support is strictly preferred over the corresponding element in the prohibition's support.  
   - Roles are preferred as: doctor > specialist > intern > extern > patient.  
   - Contexts are preferred as: intern_presc_hours > sample_analysis > afternoons.

2. **Result:**  
   - Blood analysis on sample_07 is permitted for Ben-Foster because:  
     - He holds the doctor role in South Hospital, preferred over extern.  
     - The context involves intern_presc_hours, preferred over sample_analysis and afternoons.

3. **Reasoning:**  
   - Ben-Foster's role (doctor) is higher in preference than the prohibited role (extern).  
   - The context (intern_presc_hours) is more preferred than the prohibited contexts (sample_analysis and afternoon).  
   - These satisfy the dominance condition, allowing access.

 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.";2640;220;"

**Explanation:**

1. **Decision Rules:** Access is granted if each permission's support dominates its corresponding prohibition's support. Dominance requires each element of the permission's support to be strictly preferred over the corresponding element of the prohibition's.

2. **Outcome:** Yara_Lee is granted access to perform a_operate on patinate_admin_data_3 due to meeting the dominance condition across all permissions and their respective prohibitions.

3. **Relations & Preferences:**
   - **Liberal_doctor vs. Student:** Liberal_doctor is preferred, satisfying dominance.
   - **Intern vs.Extern:** Intern is preferred, dominance holds.
   - **Surgeon vs.Extern:** Surgeon is preferred, dominance satisfied.
   - **Referent_doctor vs. Morning:** Referent_doctor is more preferred, dominance met.
   - **Emergency vs. Morning:** Emergency is preferred, dominance valid.
   - **Anesthesic_patient vs. Morning:** Anesthesic_patient is better preferred, dominance holds.

Thus, all dominance conditions are met, granting access.";0.6591995239257813;0.2754923502604167;0.1912816365559896;0.98583984375;0.97021484375;0.1268310546875;0.928;9.85;14.5;12.42;14.0;21.03;19.5

1. **Decisions Rules**: The access will be granted if, for every support of a prohibition (P), there exists a support of a permission (O) such that every element of O's support is strictly preferred to the corresponding element of P's support.

2. ** Outcomes**: The access is being granted because the conditions outlined in the decision rules have been met.

3. **Relation And Preferences**:
   - The role specialist in east_hospital is preferred to the role medical_secretaries in both east_hospital and south_hospital because specialist > medical_secretary.
   - The contexts referent_doctor and morning are preferred to sample_analysis because referent_doctor > morning > sample_analysis.
   - The presence of sample_5 in both medical_data and medical_file supports the application of the dominance criteria.
   - The employment of James_Wilson as a specialist in east hospital meets the required preference hierarchy.
   - The specific activities prescribed (prescribe_medecine) are consistent across all relevant supports.
   - The dominance of the permission's support over the prohibition's support is satisfied in all applicable cases.

**Explanation**:
- **Decision Rule**: For each prohibition's support, there must be a corresponding permission's support where each element of the permission is more preferred than the corresponding element in the prohibition.
- **Outcome**: The access is allowed because the necessary dominance conditions are fulfilled.
- **Relation and Preferences**: All relevant roles and contexts are preferred in a way that satisfies the dominance criteria, ensuring the access is granted.

**Final Answer**:
The access is granted because the dominance conditions are met for all relevant supports, ensuring that each element of the permissions' support is strictly preferred over the corresponding elements in the prohibitions' supports.

1. **Understand the Decision Rule:**
   - Access is granted if, for each prohibition's support (P), there's a corresponding permission support (O) where each element of O is strictly preferred to P.

2. **Analyze the Supports:**
   - **Permission Support:** James_Wilson holds the role specialist in East Hospital.
   - **Prohibitions Supports:**
     - Morning in East Hospital.
     - Sample_analysis in South Hospital.

3. **Evaluate Preferences:**
   - Role Preference: Specialist > Medical Secretaries.
   - Context Preference: Referent_doctor > Morning > Sample_analysis.

4. **Check Dominance:**
   - For each prohibition, find a permission where each element is more preferred.
   - Morning and Sample_analysis are less preferred than Referent_doctor.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since all prohibitions have corresponding permissions with more preferred elements, access is granted.";0.6665618896484375;0.4402923583984375;0.33551025390625;0.7470703125;0.9609375;0.1510009765625;0.9666666666666667;26.06;12.5;11.86;13.9;17.9;16.7

The access was denied due to the lack of dominance in the required conditions. Specifically, the roles and contexts in the permissions were not sufficiently preferred compared to the prohibitions, failing to meet the necessary criteria for granting access.

---

**Step-By-Starlight Explanation:**

### 1. Decision Rule:
Access is granted only if, for every prohibition's support, there exists a permission's support where each element in the permission is strictly more preferred than the corresponding element in the prohibition.

### 2. Outcome:
Access was denied.

### 3. Relations and Preferences:
- **Roles:**
  - specialist < medical_secretaries (specialist is less preferred)
  - referent_doctor > morning, sample_analysis (referent_doctor is more preferred)
- **Contexts:**
  - referent.doctor > morning, samples_analysis (referent.doctor is more preferred)

### 4. Dominance Check:
No permission support had elements that were strictly preferred to all corresponding prohibition elements. Specifically:
- The specialist role was less preferred than medical.secretaries.
- The referent.doctor context was more preferred than morning and sample_analysis, but this did not align with the required dominance for all prohibitions.

### 5. Conclusion:
Since the required dominance conditions were not fully met, access was denied.";0.5731964111328125;0.479827880859375;0.3856201171875;0.06243896484375;0.96923828125;0.0311431884765625;0.9891304347826086;23.43;13.5;12.5;14.6;18.49;17.5

The decision was to **deny access**. Here's the detailed reasoning:

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - Access is granted only if each support of a permission strictly dominates the corresponding support of a prohibition.
   - Dominance requires that every element in a permission's support is strictly preferred to the respective elements in the prohibition’s support.

2. **Outcome:**
   - The access was denied because the dominance conditions were not met.

3. **Relations, Preferences, and Dominance Check:**
   - **Roles:**
     - The role 'specialist' is less preferred compared to 'medical_secretary'.
     - The context 'referent_doctors' is more preferred than 'morning' or 'sample_analysis'.
   - **Dominance Analysis:**
     - No permission support entirely dominates the corresponding prohibition support.
     - The 'specialist' has a lower preference than 'medical_secretaries', violating the dominance requirement.
     - The contexts do not align to satisfy the dominance for all prohibited activities.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Due to the failure to meet the dominance conditions, access was denied.";0.5603830973307291;0.4730682373046875;0.3595174153645833;0.0279083251953125;0.966796875;0.0253753662109375;0.9668874172185431;24.74;13.0;13.65;14.6;16.28;15.6

- **Role: Surgen**
  - **Permissin**: Allows him to operate on sample w/ emergency.
  - **Forbidden**: North forbids him as student w/ no_anesthesia.
  - *Prioerence*: Surgen > Student; emergency > no_anesthesia.

- **Medical_Secretary**
  - **Permision**: East allows him to operate on med file with sample_analysis.

**1. Decision Rule**: Access is granted if, for each support of the permission, there exists a dominating support for the corresponding prohibition. A support dominates another if each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to the corresponding element of the prohibition's support.

**2. Outcome**: James Wilson is permitted to operate on `PATINET MEDICAL DATA_5` in the `ADMIN DATA` view.

**3. Relations and Preferences**:

- **Doctor Role**:
  - **Permission Support**: East Hospital allows James Wilson to operate in `ADMIN DATA` with the `INTERN_PRESCH` context.
  - **Contraveneing Prohibition**: North Hospital prohibits him as an `EXTERN` with the `MORNING` context.
    - **Preference Order**: Doctor (higher preference) > Extern.
    - **Context Preference**: `INTERN PRESCH` (higher) > `MORNING`.
  - **Conclusion**: Since each element of the Doctor's support is preferred, access is granted.

- **Surgeon Role**:
  ```plaintext
  - **Permissible Activity**: Operating on `SAMPLE` with `EMERGENCY` context in East Hospital.
  - **Constraining Prohibition**: North forbids as `STUDENT` with `NO ANESTHESIA`.
  - **Preference Hierarchy**: Surgeon > Student, Emergency > No Anesthesia.
  - **Dominance Check**: Each element of the Surgeon's support is preferred.
  - **Result**: Access granted due to dominance.
  ```

- **Medical Secretaries Role**:
  ```
  - **Permitting Activity**: Operating in `MEDICAL FILE` with `SAMPLE_ANALYSIS` context in EastHospital.
  - **Non-Contravening Prohibition**: No corresponding restriction in NorthHospital.
  - Thus, no impact on access.
  ```

**Summary**: The access is allowed because both the Doctor and Surgeon roles have their permission supports dominating their respective prohibitions, while the Medical Secretary role does not affect the decision.";0.4927886962890625;0.2306976318359375;0.194183349609375;0.9658203125;0.9521484375;0.87890625;0.9105691056910569;24.34;13.1;11.88;14.3;16.86;17.6

**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when, for each permission's support, there's a corresponding domination in the prohibition. A support A dominates B if each element of A is strictly preferred to B's corresponding element.

**Outcome**: 
James Wilson is permitted to perform the operate action on PATINE MEDICAL DATA_05 in the ADMIN DATA view.

**Relations and Preferences**:

1. **Doctor's Role**:
   - **Permission**: East Hospital allows operate in ADMIN_DATA with Intern_Presch.
   - **Prohibition**: North Hospital forbids as Extern with Morning.
   - **Preferences**: Doctor > Extern; Intern_Presch > Morning.
   - *Conclusion*: Doctor's support dominates, so access granted.

2. **Surgeon's Role**:
    - **Permission**: Operate in ADMIN_DATA with Emergency.
    - **Prohibition': North forbids as Student with No Anesthesia.
    - **Preferences**: Surgeon >Student; Emergency > No Anesthesis.
    - *Conclusion*: Surgeon's support dominates, access granted.

3. **Medical Secretaries' Role**:
    Only East Hospital has a permit, no corresponding prohibition, so no impact.

**Summary**: Both Doctor and Surgeon permissions meet the dominance condition, granting access.";0.46516448974609376;0.17407989501953125;0.1517425537109375;0.96533203125;0.9287109375;0.89404296875;0.9102564102564102;27.08;12.1;10.78;13.1;16.1;15.8

### 1. Decision Rule:
The access is granted if, for each support of prohibited activities, there exists a supporting activity in the permission whose support strictly dominates the prohibited one. Dominance is determined by each element of the permission's support being strictly preferred over at least one element in the prohibition's support.

### 2. Outcome:
The permission for 'Katherine Moore' to perform 'cancer analysis' on 'sample 5' in the 'liberal doctor' role is granted.

### 3. Reasons:
- **Relation 1:** The context 'Emergency' (liberal doctor) is preferred over 'No Anesthesia' (patient) due to higher preference for 'Emergency'.
- **Relation 2:** The role 'Liberal Doctor' is more preferred compared to 'Patient' because of the dominance in context.
- **Relation 3:** The context 'Morning' is less preferred than both 'Emergency' and 'No Anesthesia', ensuring dominance.
- **Conclusion:** All prohibitions are dominated by their corresponding permissions, thus access is granted.";0.6762725830078125;0.28919219970703125;0.28919219970703125;0.98046875;0.927734375;0.105224609375;0.9863945578231292;25.8;14.6;15.43;16.3;14.56;17.1

### 1. Decisión Regla:
La acceso se otorga si, para cada soporte de prohibición, existe un soporte correspondiente de permiso donde el soporte del permiso domina al del prohibición. La dominancia se define como que cada elemento del soporte del perm iso es preferido al menos en uno de los elementos del soporte de la prohibición.

### 2 Resultado:
El permiso para 'Katherine Moore’ para realizar el análisis de 'cancer' en 'sample 5’ en el rol de 'liberal doctor’ se otorga.

### 3 Razones:
- **Relación 1:** El contexto 'Emergency' en el lugar de trabajo de 'north_hospital’ es preferido sobre 'No Anesthesia’ en 'east_hospital’ debido a que 'Emergency' es más prioritario que 'No Anesthesia’. Esto asegura que el dominio del permiso supera el de la prohibición.
- **Relación 2:** El rol de 'Liberal Doctor’ es preferido a 'Patient’ en el mismo lugar de trabajo, lo que refuerza la dominancia del permiso sobre la prohibición.
-- **Relación 3:** El contexto 'Morning’ es menos preferido que ambos 'Emergency’ y 'No Anesthesia’, lo que fomenta la dominancia del permitro.
- **Conclusión:** Todos los soportes de la prohibición son superados por los correspondientes de permiso, lo que concede el acceso.";0.6677490234375;0.79217529296875;0.79217529296875;0.86572265625;0.6142578125;0.7255859375;0.3622448979591837;30.6;14.9;14.1;15.2;11.44;15.5

**Explanation:**

**1. Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted when, for each prohibition, a corresponding support exists for a permission where each element of the permutation support is strictly preferred over the prohibition's support. Dominance is determined by the strict preference of each element in the permutation's support over the prohibition's.

**2. Outcome:**  
Charlie_Brown is granted the permission to perform the delegate action on ""patinet_medical_data"" due to the dominance of the relevant permission supports over the prohibitions.

**3. Relations and Preferences:**

- **Permutation Supports:**
  - From east_hospital: ""hospital_doctor""
  - From north_hospital: ""liberal_doctor""

- **Context Preferences:**
  - ""anesthesic_patient"" is preferred over ""no_anesthesia""
  - ""morning"" is preferred over others
  - ""referent_doctor"" is higher than ""no_anesthesia""

- **Dominance:**
  - The permutation supports (hospital_doctor, liberal_doctor) are strictly preferred over the prohibited roles (extern, student).
  - The context ""anesthesic Patient"" is preferred, aligning with the required conditions for permission.

**Conclusion:**  
The access was granted because the permutation supports meet the dominance criteria over the relevant prohibitions, ensuring Charlie_Brown can perform the delegate action under the specified conditions.";0.7347808837890625;0.4783935546875;0.4110260009765625;0.88330078125;0.958984375;0.05780029296875;0.9411764705882353;2.07;19.6;18.93;19.9;21.59;26.0

**Explanation:**

To determine whether CharlieBrown can handle 'patiate MedicalData', we applied the dominance rule. Each permission must have a dominating support over its corresponding prohibition.

### 1. Role Dominance:
- **HospitalDoctor (from EastHospital)** is dominant over **extern (from WestHospital)** because HospitalDoctor is preferred.
- **LiberalDoctor from NorthHospital** is dominant over **Student roles in East and West Hospitals**.
- **AnestheticPatient and ReferentDoctor contexts** are preferred over others.

### 2. Contextual Preferences:
- The presence of preferred contexts ensures the necessary permissions are granted.

### 3. Outcome:
All dominance conditions are met, authorizing CharlieBrown to handle 'patinateMedicalData'.";0.7095644632975261;0.5922444661458334;0.5245475769042969;0.74609375;0.8291015625;0.1441650390625;0.8526315789473684;7.93;15.3;16.4;14.8;21.1;20.0

**1. Decision Rule:**  
The access is granted if, for each support of prohibitions, there exists a supporting support for permissions where the permutation's support dominates the prohibits' support. Dominance requires that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred compared to at least one component of the prohibition's support.

**2. Outcome:**  
The decision is that the permission to operate on sample_1 via a_operate is granted for Xander_Rодriguez.

**3. Relations and Preferences:**

- **Permitted Supports:**
  1. **Support 1:** East Hospital grants permission to operate on admin_data with intern role, using sample_1, under intern_presc_hour context.
  2. **_support 2:** East Hospital permits operating on admin_data with the same conditions as support 1.
  3. **Support 3:** West Hospital allows operating on admin_data but under emergency context.

- **Prohibited Supports:**
  - **Support 1 (East Hospital):** Prohibits operating on admin_data under morning context.

- **Preference Comparisons:**
  - Intern > extern
  - intern_presc_hour > morning
  - emergency > morning

- **Dominance Analysis:**
  - Each permitted support's elements (e.g., intern, sample_1, a_operate) are strictly preferred over the prohibited support's elements (morning, etc.), ensuring dominance.

Thus, the dominance condition is satisfied, leading to the permission being granted.";0.82808837890625;0.77001953125;0.534423828125;0.978515625;0.923828125;0.06634521484375;0.9523809523809523;21.29;14.3;13.9;15.8;17.57;18.0

**Decision Rule**: The access is granted based on the dominance condition. For each support of a prohibited activity, there must exist a corresponding support of a permitted activity where each element is strictly preferred to the corresponding element of the prohibited activity.

**Outcome**: Wendy_Mitchell has permission to sign on 'patinate Medical Data'.

**Reasoning**:

1. **South_Hospital**:
   - **Prohibitions**: Using 'Sample_analysis' in the context of 'sample_analysis'.
   - **Permissible Activities**: 
     - 'Intern_Prescription-Hour' (Surgeon > Student)
     - 'Anesthetics' (Doctor > Student)
   - Both contexts are present, and the preferred roles meet the dominance condition.

2. **West_Hospital**:
    - No prohibitions, thus no need for permissions.

3. **Dominance Check**:
   - All prohibitions in South_Hospital have corresponding permissible activities with strictly preferred roles.
   - No prohibitions in West_Hospital, so dominance is automatically satisfied.

**Explanation:**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - Access is granted if for each prohibition's support, there exists a permission's support where each element in the latter is strictly preferred to its corresponding element in the former.
   - Dominance is determined by strict preference in each element of the supports.

2. **Outcome:**
   - Ben_Foster is granted access to perform ""ask"" on ""patinetAdmin_data_1"" due to the dominance of preferred elements in the permission's supports over the prohibited ones.

3. **Details and Preferences:**
   - **South Hospital (Surgeon vs. Student):** Surgeon is preferred over Student, and Emergency context is preferred over others.
   - **East Hospital (Surgein vs. Student): Same preference hierarchy.
   - **West Hospital (Extern vs. Student): Surgeon preferred over Extern.
   - **Context Preferences:** Emergency > intern_presc_hour > morning > no_anesthesia.

**Conclusion:**
The access is granted because each prohibition's support is dominated by a corresponding permission's support with higher preference in roles and contexts.";0.69991943359375;0.3053131103515625;0.263055419921875;0.98388671875;0.96826171875;0.0209197998046875;0.9324324324324325;33.41;11.7;10.51;13.0;16.34;15.6

1. **DecisionRules:**
   - For access to be granted, each support of a permission must dominate the corresponding support of a prohibition. This means that for every element in a permission's support, there must be an element in the corresponding prohibition's support that is strictly preferred.

2. **Outcomes:**
   - In this case, Ben_Foster has been granted access to perform the action ""Ask"" on the data ""patiateAdmin_data_1"". This is because the supports for the permission meet the required dominance over the prohibitions.

3. **Reasons:**
   - Role Preferences: ""Surgeon,"" ""Extern,"" and ""Patient"" are all preferred over ""Student.""
   - Context Preferences: ""Emergency"" is preferred over other contexts like ""morning"" and ""no_anesthesia.""
   - These preferences create a hierarchy where the elements of the permission's supports are strictly better than those of the prohibited supports, ensuring dominance.

**Conclusion:** Access was granted because the elements of the permissions' supports dominate those of the prohibitions' supports based on role and context preferences.";0.6510971069335938;0.1505889892578125;0.13576507568359375;0.9921875;0.98876953125;0.0118255615234375;0.961038961038961;35.68;12.9;13.61;14.9;15.66;16.8

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - The access is granted if the support for each permission dominates the support for the corresponding prohibition. This requires that each element in the permission’s support is strictly preferred to an element in the prohibition’s support.

2. **Outcome:**
   - Access is granted for Ben_Foster performing ""Ask"" on ""patinateAdmin_data_1"".

   - **Role Preferences:** Roles like ""Surgeon"", ""Extern"", and ""Patient"" hold higher precedence over ""Student"".
   - **Context Preferences:** Contexts such as ""Emergency"" are more preferable than ""No Anesthesia"" and ""Morning"".

The access was granted due to the following reasons:

1. **Role and Context Preferences:**
   - Roles such as ""Surgeon,"" ""Extern,"" and ""Patient"" have higher precedence than ""Student.""
   - Contexts like ""Emergency,"" ""No Anesthesia,"" and ""Morning"" are preferred over each other.

2. **Dominance Condition:**
   - Each element in the support for the permission (e.g., ""Surgeon"") is strictly preferred over elements in the corresponding prohibition (e.g., lower-precedence roles like ""Student"").
   - Contexts also follow the same preference hierarchy, ensuring that the conditions for dominance are met.

**Explanation:**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Dominance Condition:** For each permission support, there must exist a corresponding prohibition support where each element of the permission's support (e.g., roles like doctor, anesthetist) is strictly preferred over the corresponding elements in the prohibition (e.g., patient, extern).
   - **Context Matching:** The context (like referent.doctor, afternoon) in the permission must be preferred over the context in the prohibition.

2. **Outcome:**
   - Access is granted for Mia_Anderson because each permission support (doctor, anesthetists, intern) has a corresponding prohibition support (patient, extern, patient) where the permission's roles are preferred, satisfying the dominance condition.

3. **Details Influencing the Decision:**
   - Each permission's role is preferred over the prohibited role (e.g., doctor > extern, anesthetiz > patient, intern > extern).
   - Contexts like referent.doctor and anesthesic_patient are preferred over afternoon and sample_analysis, respectively.
   - These preferences ensure that the permission's elements dominate the prohibitions, meeting the access grant criteria.";0.5366590711805556;0.3120320638020833;0.24968126085069445;0.6240234375;0.94091796875;0.443359375;0.9133333333333333;23.32;13.5;12.16;14.6;19.48;18.9

**Explanation:**

1. **Decision Rules:**
   - **Dominance Condition:** For each support in the set of prohibitions, there must exist a supporting permission where each element of the permission's support strictly dominates the corresponding element of the prohibition's support.
   - **Preference Hierarchy:** Preferences are determined based on the hierarchy of roles (e.g., doctor > medical_secretary, hospital_doctor > medical_secretary) and contexts (e.g., emergency > sample_analysis).

2. **Outcome:**
   - Eva_Clark is granted permission to perform the operation 'aOperate' on the view 'patinet_admin_data'.

3. **Analysis of Relations and Preferences:**

   - **Role Preferences:**
     - The role 'doctor' is preferred over 'medical_secretary' and 'hospital_doctor' is preferred over both.
     - The context 'emergency' is more preferred than 'sample_analysis'.

   - **Contextual Preferences:**
     These contexts influence the dominance of the supports in the permission and prohibition sets.

   - **Support Dominance:**
     Each element in the permission supports (e.g., 'doctor', 'emergency') is strictly preferred over the corresponding elements in the prohibition supports (e,g., 'medical_secretary', 'sample_analysis').

**Conclusion:**
The access was granted because Eva_Clark's roles and the contexts involved meet the dominance criteria, ensuring that her permissions are strictly preferred over the prohibited activities.";0.6754787868923611;0.37872314453125;0.2540418836805556;0.96630859375;0.9755859375;0.197265625;0.9555555555555556;12.02;15.8;15.99;16.8;20.12;21.0

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Decision Rule:**
   - Access is granted if, for each prohibition, there exists an enabling permission where each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred over the corresponding element of the prohibition's support. This is known as dominance.

2. **Identify the Supports:**
   - There are three supports for both permissions and prohibitions across different hospitals and roles.

3. **Compare Each Prohibition with Its Corresponding Permission:**
   - For each support in the prohibitions, check if there's a corresponding support in the permissions where all elements are strictly preferred.

4. **Check Element-wise Preferences:**
   - Roles: 'doctor' and especially 'hospital_doctor' are preferred over 'medical_secretary'.
   - Contexts: 'emergency' is more preferred than 'sample_analysis'.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since all prohibitions are met by their corresponding, more preferred permissions, Eva_Clar";0.43735826280381945;0.333587646484375;0.2235649956597222;0.334228515625;0.8388671875;0.54345703125;0.9844961240310077;30.46;12.8;13.31;15.1;17.97;18.1

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.";2426;1800;"Alright, let's try to figure out why the access was granted. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I need to understand the overall logic. The access is granted if, for each support in the prohibition, there's a corresponding support in the permission where the permission’s support dominates the prohibition’s. Dominance means that each element in the permission's support is strictly preferred over at least one element in the prohibition's support.

Okay, so I need to look at each support in the prohibitions and check if there's a matching support in the permissions where the permission's elements are preferred over the prohibition's.

Looking at the supports of prohibition:

1. East Hospital: role student, context morning.
2. East Hospital: same role, context morning again? Wait, no, actually, looking back, each hospital has their own set of prohibitions. Let me list them properly.

Wait, the supports of prohibition are:

- Support 1: East Hospital, student, morning.
- Support 2: East Hospital, same role, same context? Or is it different? Wait, looking back, the user listed four supports for prohibitions, each in different contexts and roles.

Wait, let me clarify:

Prohibitions:

1. East: student, morning.
2. South: student, morning (maybe same context? Or different hospitals have same context? Hmm, not sure. Need to check.)

Wait, the user provided four supports for prohibited actions:

1. East, student, morning
2. East, same role, morning? Or is it the same as first? Wait, looking at the user's input:

Wait, the user wrote:

3. **Sup of Proh:**

(sup 1): east, student, morning

(sup 2): east, student?

Wait, no, let me re-examine the user's input.

Wait, the user says:

3. Supports of Prohibition:

(support 1):

east_hospital, student, morning.

support 2:

east_hospital, same role? Or is it another role?

Wait, looking back, perhaps I misread. Let me parse the user's data correctly.

In the user's message, under 3. Supports of prohibits, there are four supports:

1. east_hospital, role student, morning.

2. east_hospital again, role student? Or is it a different role?

Wait, no. Looking at the user's text:

- (support 1): east_hospital grants student the prohibition to validate on medical_file, context morning.

- (support 2): east_hospital, same as above? Or is it same hospital but different context?

Wait, the user lists four separate supports for prohibitions:

1. east, student, context morning

2. east, same role? No, wait:

Looking at the user's points:

1. east: student, morning

2. same hospital, same role, but same context? Or same hospital, different context? Wait, the user says for support 2: east_hospital, student role, context morning.

Wait, no, looking at the exact user input:

3. **Support of Prohibition:**

(support 1):
east_hospital grants role student the prohibition to perform validate on medical_file with context morning.

(support 2):
east_hospital again, same role? Maybe not. Wait, the user wrote four separate supports:

Actually, the user lists:

1. east employs student, context morning.

2. same for east, but same role? Or different?

Wait, the second support is:

""east_hospital considers sign and sample_5, context morning.""

Wait, no, the user wrote for each support:

Each support is a separate entry. So:

Support 1: east, student role, morning context.

Support 2: east, same role, maybe same context? Or does it refer to a different context?

Wait no, the user said:

For the supports of prohibition, there are four:

1. East grants student the prohibition, context morning.

But then also:

2. East grants student again? Or is it east grants someone else?

Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake, but according to the user's input, the four supports are:

1. east grants student, context morning (same hospital, same role)

2. east grants same role, but different context? Or same context?

Wait, looking again:

No, the user wrote multiple supports for each hospital.

Wait, perhaps it's better to note that each support is a separate case.

So, the user has four separate supports for prohibited actions, each in a different context and possibly different roles.

Similarly, the supports for permission are also four, each in a specific context and role.

Now, the decision outcome is that the permission for Dylan Nelson to perform sign on Sample 5 is granted.

So, to explain why, I need to see for each prohibition support, whether there's a corresponding permission support where the permission's dominance condition is met.

Let me go through each prohibition support and find a matching permission support.

Starting with the first prohibition support:

1. East_hospital, role=student, context=morning.

We need to find a permission support where:

- The role in the permission support is 'student' (since the prohibition is for 'student'), and the context is 'morning'.

Looking at the permission supports:

- East_hospital has three supports:

   a. role=nurse, context=referent_doctor.

   b. role=nurse again, same context.

   c. role=intern, context=emergency.

   d. role=anesthetist, context=anesthesic_patient.

So, none of the permission supports have 'student' as the role. Therefore, for the first prohibition support (east, student, morning), there is no corresponding permission support where 'student' is the role. Hence, the dominance condition is not met for this support.

Wait, but the decision outcome was that the permission was granted. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the dominance is not about the same role but about the entire support.

Wait, the dominance is that each element of the permission's support must dominate the prohibition's. So, perhaps the permission's support includes more elements, not just the role.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the entire support, not just the single role.

Wait, each support is a list of elements. For example, a permission support might include multiple roles, but in the user's data, each support seems to have a single role.

Wait no, looking back:

In the user's data:

Supports of permission:

1. East has three supports:

a. role=nurse

b. role=nurse (again?)

c. role=intern

Wait, no, each support is for a specific role. So, each permission support is for a single role.

Similarly, each prohibition support is for a particular role.

So, for each prohibition support (e.g., east, student, morn), we need a permission support where the role is 'student' and the context is morn.

But in the user's permission supports, there's no 'student' role. So, how did the access get granted?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the dominance condition. Maybe the dominance is not per role but across the entire support.

Alternatively, perhaps the dominance applies to each element in the support. So, for each element in the permutation's support, it must dominate the corresponding element in the prohibition support.

Wait, perhaps each support is a set of elements, and for each element (role, context, etc.), the permission's element is preferred over the prohibited's.

But in the given data, each support is just a single role and a single context. So, perhaps for each support in prohibition, we need a corresponding support in permission where the role is the same, and the context is the same, but the preference is that the permission's role is preferred to the prohibition's role.

Wait, but in the first prohibition support, the role is student, and in the permission supports, the roles are nurse, intern, anesthetist.

So, the dominance would require that the permission's roles are preferred over the prohibited roles.

Wait, the preference is that 'nurse' is preferred over 'student', 'anesthetist' over 'student', etc.

So, for the first forbidden support (student, morning), the corresponding permission support would need to have a role that is preferred to 'student', such as 'nurse' or 'anestherist' or 'medical_secretary'.

But in the user-provided data, the permission supports for east_hospital are:

1. role=nurse";0.38694407145182297;0.3644866943359375;0.1883977254231771;0.34326171875;0.701171875;0.66259765625;0.988791032826261;60.51;7.5;6.06;10.4;10.54;9.3

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Decision Rule:**
   - Access is granted if for each prohibition, there's an enabling permission where the permutation of the permission's support entirely dominates the prohibition's support.
   - Dominance is when each element of the permission's set is strictly preferred over at least one element in the corresponding prohibition's set.

2. **Identify Relevant Prohibitions and Permissions:**
   - **Prohibitions:**
     - North Hospital: Extern role with afternoon context.
     - East Hospital: Medical Secretary role with morning context.
   - **Permitted Permissions:**
     - South Hospital: Surgeon role with internal_presc_hour context.
     - West Hospital: Specialist role with emergency context.

3. **Analyze Each Prohibition and Its Corresponding Permission:**

   a. **North Hospital Prohibition (Extern, Afternoon):**
      - **Permission:** South Hospital (Surgeon, Intern_Presc_Hour)
      - **Preferences:**
        - Surgeon > Extern
        - Intern_Presc Hour > Afternoon
      - **Result:** The permission's elements are preferred, so the condition is met.

   b. **East Hospital Prohibition (Medical Secretary, Morning):**
      – **Permission:** West Hospital (Specialist, Emergency)
      – **Preferences:**
          - Specialist > Medical Secretary
          - Emergency > Morning
      – **Result:** The condition is satisfied.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Both prohibitions have corresponding permissions meeting the dominance criteria.
   - Therefore, access is granted.

**Final Answer:**

The access is granted because both prohibitions from North and East Hospitals have corresponding permissions where each element of the permissions' support is strictly preferred over the respective elements of the prohibitions' support. This satisfies the dominance condition, allowing Xander Rodrigues the necessary access.";0.6015625;0.9248046875;0.6390380859375;0.2467041015625;0.9638671875;0.7666015625;0.9401709401709402;13.95;15.0;13.24;17.1;20.41;20.5

**Explanation:**

**1. Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted when, for every support in the prohibition list, there exists a permutation in the permission list where each element of the permutation is strictly preferred to the corresponding element in the prohibition support.

**2. Outcome:**  
The access is granted, specifically allowing Olivia_Scott from west_hospital to perform the delegate activity on prescription_3.

**3. Relations and Preferences:**

- **Organizational and Role Hierarchy:**  
  Olivia_Scott's role as a liberal_doctor in west_hospital is preferred over patient, medical_secretary, and anesthetist in other hospitals.

**Explanation:**

1. **Decision Rules:**  
   Access is granted if, for each support in the prohibition, there's a supporting permutation in the permission where every element is strictly preferred to its corresponding element.

2. **Outcomes:**  
   Olivia_Scott is granted the permission to handle the 'delegate' activity on 'prescription_3' in the west_hospital.

3. **Reasons:**  

   - **Role and Context Preferences:**  
     Olivia_Scott holds higher-preferred roles (e.g., liberal_doctor, anasthesitist) compared to patient, medical_secretaries, and others in different contexts (e.g., emergency vs. afternoon, no_anesthesia).

   - **View and Activity Focus:**  
     The focus is on handling specific data types (personal_data, medical_file) over less critical ones (admin_data, sample).

**Conclusion:**  
Based on the hierarchical preferences of roles and contexts, along with the focus on specific data activities, the access is allowed.";0.6165715535481772;0.1096954345703125;0.10307566324869792;0.99169921875;0.92529296875;0.046905517578125;0.9159663865546218;9.38;16.8;17.03;17.3;18.22;20.2

**Explanation:**

To determine whether access is granted, we apply the following decision rules:

1. **Role Preferences:** Olivia_Scott holds the highest-preferred roles (liberal_doctor, anesthetist) compared to other roles like patient and medical_secretaries.

2. **Context Preferences:** The context 'emergency' is the highest priority, followed by 'afternoon', 'morning', and 'no_anesthesia'.

3. **View Focus:** The focus is on activities related to 'medical_file' rather than 'admin_data' or 'sample'.

4. **Activity Focus:** The specific activity of handling 'delegate' is prioritized over other activities.

By integrating these factors, the system concludes that the access is granted.";0.38420664469401045;0.05287933349609375;0.051167805989583336;0.55419921875;0.30615234375;0.043365478515625;0.9775280898876404;14.15;15.0;15.36;15.0;17.33;17.7

1. **Understand the Decision Rule:**
   Access is granted if, for each role's permission, there's a matching role's prohibition where the permission's elements are strictly preferred to the prohibition's elements.

2. **Identify the Key Elements:**
   - **Permission:** Olivia_Scott has the role of anesthetist with the ability to handle 'medical_file' due to the 'referent.doctor' context in west_hospital.
   - **Prohibition:** Olivia_Scott is prohibited from handling 'admin_data', 'sample', and 'medical_file' under certain contexts in north_hospital.

3. **Apply the Dominance Rule:**
   - The 'handling on medical_file' in west_hospital is preferred over the same activity in north_hospital's 'afternoon' and 'morning' contexts.
   - The 'referent.doctors' context is the highest preference, dominating the lower contexts.

4. **Conclude Access Granting:**
   Since the permission's support (west_hospital, referent_doctor) is strictly preferred over the prohibition's (north_hospital, afternoon/morning), access is granted.

**Final Answer:**

Access is granted for Olivia_Scott because her role as anesthetist in west_hospital, handling 'medical_file', is preferred over the prohibitions in north_hospital, where she is restricted in 'admin_data' and 'sample' activities.";0.8017008463541668;0.85955810546875;0.7417195638020834;0.81689453125;0.92431640625;0.333984375;0.9753086419753086;11.31;16.1;14.13;16.3;19.78;20.9

An access is granted if and only if,         for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.         Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.";1981;1801;"Okay, so I need to figure out why access was granted based on the given logic. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the overall logic says that access is granted if, for each support in the prohibition, there's a corresponding support in the permission where the permission’s support dominates the prohibition’s. Dominance means each element in the permission's support is strictly preferred to the corresponding element in the prohibition's support.

Looking at the supports, there are three permissions and three prohibitions. Each support in the permission needs to dominate the corresponding support in the prohibition.

Let me list out the permissions and their supports:

1. **Permission Supports:**
   - Support 1: role doctor, context intern_presc-hour
   - Support 2: role specialist, context intern-presc-hour
   -(Wait, actually, looking back, the supports for permissions are listed as support 1, 2, 3, each with different roles and contexts. Similarly for prohibitions.)

Wait, maybe I should clarify:

From the given data:

**Supports of Permission:**
- Support 1: Role doctor; context intern_presc...
- Support 2: Role specialist; same context?
- Support 3: Role intern; different context.

Wait, no, let me re-examine:

Looking back, the supports of permission are:

1. (support 1): role doctor, context= intern_presc_hour
2. (support 2): role specialist, context= internpresc_hour
3. (support 3): role intern, context= anesthesic_patient

Similarly, the supports of prohibition are:

1. support 1: role extern, context= sample_analysis
2. support 2: role student, context=sample_analysis
3. support 3: role patient, context=afternoon

Now, the decision outcome is that Ben_Foster is granted permission to perform blood_analyze on sample_5.

Wait, but how does that connect? Let me think.

Each permission support must dominate its corresponding prohibition support.

So, for each i from 1 to 3, the i-th permission support must dominate the i-th prohibition support.

But wait, the number of permissions and prohibitions are both 3, so we have to check for each i, whether the permission's support i dominates the prohibition's support i.

So, let's pair them:

1. Permission support 1: doctor, context=intern_presc_hour
   Prohibition support 1: extern, context=sampleanalysis

2. Permission support 2: specialist, context=internpresc_hour
   prohibiting support 2: student, context= sampleanalysis

3. Permission support 3: intern, context=anesthesic_patient
   Prohibiting support 3: patient, context= afternoons

Now, for each i, check if the permission's support_i is preferred to the prohibition's support_i.

What does it mean for the support to be preferred?

Each element in the support is strictly preferred. So, for the i-th support, the role in the permission must be preferred to the role in the prohibition, and the context must be preferred as well.

Wait, but the context is the same in some cases. For example, in support 1, the context is intern_presc_hour for both permission and prohibition.

Wait, no: for i=1, the permission's context is intern_preschour, and the prohibition's context is sample_analysis. Wait, no, the context is part of the support.

Wait, each support is a combination of the role and the context.

So, for support 1:

- permission: role=doctor, context=intern_presc_hour
- prohibition: role=extern, context=sampleAnalysis

So, to check if the permission support 1 dominates prohibition support 1, we need to check two things:

1. The role in the permission (doctor) is preferred over the role in prohibition (extern).

2. The context in the permission (intern_presc_hour) is preferred over context in prohibition (sample_analysis).

Similarly for the other supports.

So, first, let's determine the preference order of roles and contexts.

From the preferences given:

- doctor > extern > student > patient

- The contexts:

Looking at the contexts:

- intern_presc_hour

- sample_analysis

- afternoon

- anesthesic_patient (probably a typo, should be ""anesthesia Patient""?)

Assuming it's ""anesthesia Patient"", then the contexts are:

- afternoon

- intern_preschour

- sample_analysis 

- anesthesia Patient

Wait, but in the supports, the contexts are:

1. For support 1: intern_presc hour

2. For support 2: sample_analysis

3. For support 3: afternoon

Wait, no, looking back:

In the supports of prohibition:

1. context sample_analysis

2. context sample_analysis (same as 1?)

Wait, no, the prohibits are:

1. role extern, context sample_analysis

Wait, no:

Looking back:

Prohibitions:

1. role external, context sample_analysis, in east hospital.

2. role student, context sample_analysis in east hospital.

3. role patient, context afternoon in west hospital.

Wait, now I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I need to list all the supports with their details.

Let me try to list all the permissions and their respective supports:

1. Permission Support 1:
   - role: doctor
   - context: intern_preschour
   - hospital: south
   - details: uses Ben_Foster, sample_5 in view medical_data

2. Permission Support 2:
   - role:specialist
   - context:intern_preschour (same as above)
   - hospital: same? Or different?

Wait, no, perhaps each support is a separate condition.

Wait, the user provided three supports for permissions and three for prohibitions, each with their own details.

So, for the purposes of this analysis, I need to pair each permission support with the corresponding prohibition support.

Assuming that the i-th support in permissions corresponds to the i-th in prohibitions.

So:

1. Perm Supp 1: role=doctor; context=intern_preschour; hospital=south; uses Ben_Foster; view=medical_data

   Proh Supp 1:
   role=extern; context=sample_analysis; hospital=east; uses Ben_Foester; view=admin_data

2. Perm Supp2: role=specialist; context=intern Preschour; hospital= south; uses Ben_F oster; view= medical data

   Proh supp2: role=student; context= sample_analysis; hospital= east; uses Ben_F; view= admin_data

3. Perm supp3: role= intern; context= anesthics_patient; hospital= south ; uses Ben_F;view= personal_data

   Prohi supp3: role=patient; context=afternoon; hospital= west; uses Ben_F in personal_data

Wait, but the decision outcome is about Ben_Foster performing blood_analyse on sample_5, which is sample_5 in medical_data.

Wait, sample_5 is in the view of medical_data, which is used in the south hospital for doctor and specialist roles.

So, the access is being granted for Ben_F in the role of doctor in the south hospital to perform blood_analyse (which is sample_5) in medical_data.

Now, according to the decision rule, for each prohibition support, there must be a corresponding permission support that dominates it.

So, the three prohibitions are:

1. In east hospital, external role, sample_analysis, view admin_data.

2. In east hospital student role, sample_analysis view admin_data.

3. In west hospital, patient role, afternoon context, view personal_data.

And the permissions are:

1. South hospital, doctor role, intern_preschour context, view medical_data.

2. South hospital, specialist, intern_presch our context, view medical data.

3. South hospital, intern role, anesthetic_patient context, view personal data.

So, to apply the rule, for each i=1,2,3:

Check if perm_support_i dominates proh_support_i.

Meaning:

For each i, the role in perm_support_i must be preferred to role in proh_support_i, and the context in perm_supporti must be preferred to context in proh_supporti.

Additionally, the hospital, view, and other details must match? Or is that not considered?

Wait, the dominance is based on the elements (roles and contexts) regardless of the hospital and view.

Wait, the decision rule says";0.5855577256944444;0.10796101888020833;0.0985141330295139;0.93798828125;0.90966796875;0.1263427734375;0.9382379654859219;41.26;10.8;8.19;12.6;14.54;13.6

**Decision Rule:**  
The access is granted if, for each i (from 1 to N), the corresponding permission's support is strictly preferred to the prohibition's support. This means that for each i, the role and context in the permission must be preferred over those in the prohibition.

**Outcome:**  
Access is granted for Ben_Foster, who is a doctor in the South Hospital, to perform the blood_analysis activity on sample_5 within the medical_data view.

**Details of the Decision-Making Process:**

- **i=1:**  
  - **Permission Support:**  
    - Role: Doctor in South Hospital  
    - Context: intern_presc_h (a specific time when a patient can be prescribed a medication)  
  - **Prohibition_support:**  
    - Case: Extern in East Hospital  
    - Uses sample_analysis (a general context)  
  - Since Doctor is preferred over Extern, and the specific context (intern_presc_h) is preferred over the general context (sample_analysis), the condition is satisfied.

- **i=2:**  
  - Both the permission and prohibition supports involve Ben_Foster, but in different roles:  
    - **Permission:** Specialist in South Hospital, with the same context as i=1.  
    - **Prohibition:** Student in East Hospital, using the same context.  
  - Specialist is preferred over Student, so the condition is satisfied.  

- **i=3:**  
  - In this case, the roles and contexts are:  
    - Permission: Intern in South Hospital, using an anesthesic_patient (a specific patient category).  
    - Prohibition: Patient in West Hospital, using afternoon (a specific time of day).  
  - Intern is preferred over Patient, and the specific patient category (anesthse.Patient) is preferred over afternoon.  
  - Thus, the condition is met.  

**Conclusion:**  
All three conditions have been met, so the access is granted.";0.7659342447916666;0.8452555338541666;0.7671305338541666;0.94384765625;0.55859375;0.28515625;0.9182879377431906;35.98;12.8;10.85;14.7;14.68;16.3

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.";1532;1801;"Alright, let's try to figure out why the access was granted. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I need to understand the overall logic. The access is granted if, for each support in the prohibition, there's a corresponding support in the permission where the permission’s support dominates the prohibition’s. Dominance means that each element in the permission's support is strictly preferred over at least one element in the prohibition's support.

Okay, so I need to look at each support in the prohibitions and check if there's a matching support in the permissions that dominates it.

Looking at the supports:

There are two supports for permissions and three for prohibitions. Let me list them out.

**Supports of Permission:**
1. Support 1: South Hospital, role doctor, activity consult on personal_data, context emergency.
2. Support 2: East Hospital, role intern, activity consult on sample, context referentDoctor.

Wait, actually, looking back, the supports of permission are two, but the supports of prohibition are three. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me check again.

Wait, the user provided:

Supports of Permission:
- (support 1): South Hospital, doctor, consult personal_data, emergency.
- (support 2): East Hospital, intern, consult sample, referentDoctor.

Supports of Prohibitions:
- (support1): South, student, consult medical_data, afternoon.
- (support2): West, patient, consult sample, morning.
- (support3): West, extern, consult admin_data, sample_analysis.

So, three prohibitions and two permissions.

But the decision outcome is about Quinn_Thomas getting access. So, perhaps the key is to see if each prohibition's support has a permission's support that dominates it.

Wait, but the dominance is from the permission's support to the prohibition's. So, for each prohibition's support, there must be a permission's support where each element in permission is strictly preferred over the corresponding in the prohibition.

Wait, no, the dominance is that each element of the permission's support (i.e., the elements that make the permission valid) is strictly preferred over each element of the prohibition's support. So, the permission's elements must dominate the prohibition's.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to structure it.

Each support in the prohibition must be dominated by a support in the permission.

So, for each of the three prohibitions, I need to find a permission support that dominates it. If all three are dominated, then access is granted.

But the outcome is that access is granted, so presumably, all prohibitions are dominated by some permission.

Wait, but there are three prohibitions and only two permissions. How can all three be dominated? Maybe one permission dominates two prohibitions, and the other permission dominates one.

Alternatively, perhaps the dominance is per element, not per support.

Wait, the dominance is defined as each element of the permutation's support is preferred over at least once in the prohibition's. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the definition says: ""Dominance means that: Each element of the support... is strictly preferred to ... at least one element.""

So, for a permission support to dominate a prohibition support, every element in the permission support must be strictly preferred to at leas one element in the prohibited support.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think.

Suppose the permission support has elements P1, P2, P3, and the prohibition support has Q1, Q2, Q3.

For the permission to dominate the prohibition, each P must be strictly preferred over at lease one Q.

But I'm not sure if it's per element or per support.

Wait the dominance is that the entire support of the permission dominates the entire support ofthe prohibition. So, each element of the perm support is strictly preferred to each element of the prohib support? Or just that for each perm element, there's at least one in the prohib that it's preferred over.

I think it's the latter. So, for the permission support to dominate the prohibition support, for each element in the perm support, there exists at least one elementin the prohib support that it is preferred over.

So, for example, if the perm support has elements A, B, C, and the prohib support has X, Y, Z, then for the perm to dominate, A must be > X, Y, or Z; B must be > X,Y,Z; and C must be >X,Y,Z.

But that seems too strict. Maybe it's that each perm element is > at least one prohib element, but not necessarily all.

Wait, the exact wording is: ""each element of the supportof the permission is strictlypreferred to at least oneelement of the support ofthe prohibition.""

So, for each perm element p, there exists a q in the prohib support such that p > q.

So, the perm support's elements must each be > at least one in prohib's support.

So, for the entire support to dominate, each perm element must have at least one preferable element in the prohib support.

But wait, the dominance is from perm to prohib, meaning that the perm's support dominates the prohib's. So, the perm's support must be such that each of its elements is strictly preferred to some element in the prohib's support.

Wait, but in the decision, the access is granted, which suggests that for each prohibition, there is a corresponding permission that dominates it.

So, let's look at the prohibitions and see if they are dominated by any of the permissions.

First, the three prohibitions:

1. South Hospital: role student, activity consult on medical_data, context afternoon.

2. West Hospital: role patient, consult sample on view, context morning.

3. WestHospital: role extern, consult on admin_data, context sample_analysis.

And the two permissions:

1. SouthHospital: role doctor, consult on personal_data with context emergency.

2. EastHospital: role intern, consult on sample with referentDoctor.

Now, the outcome is that Quinn_Thomas is granted access to describe on patinetAdminData2.

Wait, but how does that relate?

Wait, perhaps the specific access is for Quinn_Thomas, so we need to see if his roles and activities meet the conditions.

Wait, perhaps the decision is about a specific user, Quinn_Thomas, and whether he can perform a certain action.

But the details are a bit unclear.

Wait, the outcome is ""the permission for Quinn_ Thomas to perform describe onpatinetAdminData2 is granted.""

So, the specific action is: perform describe (probably a role) on patinetAdmin2 (probably a view or data).

So, to determine why, we need to see which prohibitions apply to this action and whether the permission supports dominate the prohibitions.

But perhaps the key is that for each prohibition that applies to this action, there is a permission that dominates it, thus granting access.

But I'm a bit lost. Let me try another approach.

The decision rule is that for each support of the prohibition, there must exist a corresponding support of the permission where the permutation's support (I think it's a typo for permission) dominates the prohibition's.

Meaning, for each prohibition support S, there exists a permission support P such that P dominates S.

So, for all S in Prohibitions, exists P in Permissions where P dominates S.

If that's the case, access is granted.

In the given case, the outcome is access granted, so likely all three prohibitions are being checked, and each has a dominating permission.

But since there are only two permissions, one of them must dominate two prohibitions, or each of the three is dominated by one of the two.

Wait, but with three prohibitions, it's impossible for two permissions to each dominate two, unless one dominates two and the other dominates one.

So, perhaps one of the permissions dominates two of the prohibitions.

Looking at the specifics:

Permutations:

1. SouthH: doctor, consult personalData, context emergency.

2.EastH: intern, consult sampleView, context referent Doctor.

Prohibitions:

1.SouthH: student, consult medicalData, afternoon.

2.WestH: patient consult sample, morning.

3.WestH: extern consult adminData, sampleAnalysis.

Now, the access outcome is for Quinn_Thomson to perform 'describe' on 'patinet_admin_data2'.

I'm not sure what 'describe' refers to, but perhaps it's a role or an activity.

But perhaps the specific action is 'perform describe' which is a role, and the object is patinet_admin_data2, which is a view";0.4042978922526042;0.12351481119791667;0.11135355631510417;0.73681640625;0.66845703125;0.61865234375;0.9668924003009782;49.52;9.7;7.23;12.0;10.83;10.1

The decision to grant Quinn_Thomas access to perform the action ""describe"" on the view ""patinet_admin_data_₂"" is based on the dominance condition. This condition requires that for each prohibited scenario, there exists a permitted action that dominates it. 

Dominance is established when each element in the permitted action's support is strictly preferred over at le ast one element in the prohibited scenario's support. In this case:

1. **Roles and Contexts**: Quinn_Thomas's role (doctor, intern, extern) is preferred over student, patient, or extern. The contexts (emergency, referent_doctor, sample_analysis) are also strictly preferred over afternoon, morning, or sample_analysis.

2. **Element-wise Preference**: Each element in the permitted actions (like doctor, intern, external) is strictly preferred over the corresponding prohibited roles. Similarly, the contexts (emergency, referring doctor, sample_analysis) follow the same preference hierarchy.

The decision to grant access is based on the principle of dominance, where each forbidden scenario is outweighed by a corresponding allowed action. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Dominance Details**:
    - **Quinn_Thomas as a Doctor**: Dominates being a student due to role preference.
    - **Emergency Context**: Outweighs the afternoon context.
    - **Doctor Role**: Overrules both patient and extern roles.
    - **Referent_doctor Context**: Precedes morning.
    - **Intern Role**: Supersedes patient.
    - **External Role**: Exceeds doctor and intern roles.

1. **DecisionRule:** Access is granted when, for each support in the permission, there's a corresponding support in the prohibition where each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to its corresponding element in the prohibition's support. This is known as dominance, where each element in the permission is better than the corresponding element in the prohibited activity.

2. **Result:** Victor_Turne is granted permission to prescribing on data_3 due to the dominance of preferred roles and contexts.

3. **Factors Influencing the Decision:**
   - Role Hierarchy: Nurse is preferred over Doctor, who is preferred over Surgeon, then Extern, and finally Patient.
   - Context Hierarchy: anesthesicPatient is preferred over intern_presc_hour, which is preferred over noAnesthesia, then afternoon.
   - Specific Scenarios:
     - In West_Hospital, the context is an anesthesicPatient.
     - In East_Hospital, it's an intern_presc_hour.
     - In North_Hospital, again an anesthesic.Patient.
   - All these contexts dominate the prohibited activities, ensuring the dominance condition is met.

**Conclusion:** The dominance of higher-preferred roles and contexts allows Victor_Turner’s permission to be granted.";0.6112528483072917;0.5534261067708334;0.253326416015625;0.96337890625;0.9443359375;0.658203125;0.9096385542168675;29.96;13.0;13.4;15.4;17.92;17.2

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.";2465;453;"

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Decision Rule:**
   - **Access Granting Rule:** Victor_Turner's permission to prescribe is granted if, for every support in his permission, there exists a dominating support in the corresponding prohibition.
   - **Dominance:** Each element in the permission's support must be strictly preferred to the corresponding element in any prohibiting support.

2. **Breaking Down the Roles and Contexts:**
   - Victor_Turner holds multiple roles across different hospitals:
     - **Nurse** in West_Hospital
     - **Doctor** in East_Hospital
     -(Surgeon) in North_Hospital

3. **Role Hierarchy:**
   - The preferred order of roles is:
     1. Surgeon
     2. Doctor
     3. Nurse
     4. Extern
     5. Patient

4. **Context Hierarchies:**
   - Preferred contexts within each hospital:
     - **West_Hospital:** anesthetist
     - **East_Hospital:** intern_presc_hour
     - **North_Hospital:** an esthetsic_patient

5. **Specific Scenarios:**
   - Each hospital provides a unique context where Victor_Turner can exercise his permission:
     - **Prescription in West_Hospital (Nurse role, anesthetic context):** Allowed because nurse is preferred over patients.
     - **Prescribing in East_Hospital (Doctor role, intern_presc context):** Allowed due to doctor's preference over externs.
     - **Permitting in North_Hospital (Surgeon role, anestheta context):** Permissible as surgeon is the highest preferred role.

6. **Dominance Verification:**
   - For each permission element, a corresponding prohibition element is less preferred:
     - Example: As a nurse in West_Hospital, prescription is allowed because anesthetist (context) and nurse (role) are both preferred over their respective prohibitions.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - All conditions for dominance are met across the various roles and contexts Victor_Turner operates in, thus granting him the permission to prescribe.";0.6000698513454861;0.7569173177083334;0.5905999077690972;0.56298828125;0.767578125;0.677734375;0.9547325102880658;16.83;16.0;15.1;17.1;19.43;21.9

**1. Decision Rule**:  
The access is granted if, for each support of prohibited access, there exists a supporting support for permitted access such that each element of the permitted support is strictly preferred over the corresponding element in the prohibited support.

**2. Outcomes**:  
The decision outcome is that access is granted for the role of anesthetist for Xander_Rодriguez to perform the operation on patinet_admin_date_4.

**3. Relations and Preferences**:

- **Permitted Access Supports**:
  1. **South Hospital**: Roles include anesthetist.
  2. **East Hospital**: Roles include medical_secretary and student.
  3. **North Hospital**: Role includes patient.

- **Prohibited Access Supports**:

  1. East Hospital: Student role with no_anesthesia context.
  2., North Hospital: Patient role with afternoon context.
  3., South Hospital: Anesthetist role with referent_doctor context.

- **Preferences**:
  - Anesthetist > Medical_secretary > Student > Patient.
  - Referent_doctor > Afternoon > No_anesthesia.

- **Dominance**:
  - Each element in the permitted supports is strictly preferred over their counterparts in the prohibited supports.
  - For example, anesthetists are preferred over medical_secretaries, who are preferred over students, who are in turn preferred over patients.

**Explanation**:  
The access was granted because each support in the prohibited access had a corresponding support in permitted access where each element was strictly preferred.

   - Access is granted when, for each support in the prohibitions, there exists a permutation support where the permutation's elements are strictly preferred to the respective elements in the prohibition's support.

2. **Analyzing the Supports:**
   - **Permutation Supports:**
     - Doctor with Emergency context.
     - Patient with Morning context.
   - **Prohibitions:**
     - Medical Secretary with Afternoon context.
     - Doctor with Evening context.

3. **Evaluating Preferences:**
   - Role preferences: Doctor > Medical Secretary > Patient.
   - Context preferences: Emergency > Afternoon > Morning.

4. **Checking Dominance:**
   - The Doctor's Emergency context dominates both the Medical Secretary's Afternoon and the Patient's Morning contexts because Doctor is preferred over Medical Secretary, and Emergency is preferred over Afternoon and Morning.
   - The Patient's Morning context does not have a dominating permutation because the highest preferred roles (Doctor) do not have a higher context than Morning.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the Doctor's Emergency context satisfies the dominance condition for both prohibited supports, access is granted for that part.
   - The absence of a dominating permutation for the Patient's Morning context means access is denied for that part.

**Final Outcome:**
Access is granted for the Doctor's Emergency permit but denied for the Patient'sMorning permit based on the dominance criteria.";0.546490478515625;0.4900054931640625;0.4900054931640625;0.544921875;0.88525390625;0.677734375;0.9646017699115044;21.29;14.3;11.61;14.6;16.99;17.0

**1. Decision Rules:** Access is granted when each support of a permission is dominated by a corresponding support of a prohibition. Dominance is determined by strict preference in roles and contexts.

**2. Outcome:**
- **Zane_Gonzalez's Access Granted:**
  - **Role:** doctor
  - **Context:** emergency
  - **Reason:** doctor is preferred over other roles, and emergency is the highest preferred context.

- **Access Denied:**
  - No domination found for the patient's morning context.

**3. Details Influencing the Decision:**
- **Roles Preferred:** doctor is the highest, followed by medical_secretary, then patient.
- **Contexts Preferred:** emergency is the highest, then afternoon, then morning.
- **Permutation Check:**
  - For the doctor's emergency context, the highest preferred role (doctor) with the highest context (emergency) dominates both prohibited supports.
  - For the patient's morning, no higher role or context exists to dominate.

**4. Conclusion:**
Access is allowed for the doctor with the emergency context due to dominance, but denied for the patient with the morning context as it doesn't meet the criteria.";0.574755859375;0.168060302734375;0.168060302734375;0.66748046875;0.91796875;0.04779052734375;0.9939024390243902;37.3;12.3;11.77;13.0;14.85;16.5

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Decision Rule:**
   - Access is granted if, for each forbidden action (prohibition), there's a corresponding allowed action (permission) where the allowed's support dominates the forbidden's.

2. **Analyzing Permissions and Prohibitions:**
   - **Permission Supports:**
     - Role: Hospital.Doctor, View Medical File, Context Intern.Prescription.HOUR in West.Hospital.
     - Role: Patient & Medical_secretary, View Admin Data, Context Afternoon & No.Anesthesia in West., North., and East.Hospital.
   - **Prohibition Supports:**
     Each has a specific role, view, context, and organization.

3. **Evaluating Dominance:**
   - Each forbidden support is matched with a permission support where:
     - Roles: Doctor > Patient > Medical_secretary
     - Contexts: Intern.Prescription > Afternoon > No.Anesthesia

4. **Preference Hierarchy:**
   - Roles and contexts are strictly preferred, ensuring dominance.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - All forbidden supports are dominated, so Rachel_Baker's access is granted.";0.4642120361328125;0.06665802001953125;0.06665802001953125;0.70458984375;0.87939453125;0.396240234375;0.9230769230769231;11.07;14.1;12.57;13.4;20.73;20.0

**Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted when, for each prohibition, a corresponding permission exists where the permission's elements (roles, views, contexts, and organizations) are strictly preferred to the prohibition's elements.

**Outcome:**  
Rachel_Baker is granted access to handle_db on Sample_1.

**Relations and Preferences Influencing the Decision:**  
1. **Role Preferences:**  
   - Hospital.Doctor > Patient > Medical_Secretary  
   - Example: Hospital.Doctor in West.Hospital dominates Patient and Medical_Secretary in other hospitals.

2. **Context Preferences:**  
   ```  
   intern_presc_hour > afternoon > no_anesthesia  
   ```
   - Example: `intern_presc_hour` in West.Hospital is preferred over `afternoon` in North.Hospital and `no_anesthesia` in East.Hospital.

3. **Organization Preferences:**  
   No direct preference between organizations, but roles and contexts within each organization determine dominance.

**Conclusion:**  
All prohibitions are dominated by their corresponding permissions, ensuring Rachel_Baker can perform the required action.";0.652618408203125;0.3339385986328125;0.3339385986328125;0.97412109375;0.927734375;0.306640625;0.8292682926829268;2.61;15.3;12.92;14.2;22.99;20.9

**Explanation:**

**1. Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted when each support of a permission is dominated by a corresponding support of a prohibition. Dominance is determined by strict preference of each element in the permutation's support over at least one in the prohibition's.

**2. Outcome:**  
Olivia_Scott is granted permission to perform biopsy on prescribed_4 due to dominance conditions met across all relevant supports.

**3. Relations and Preferences:**  
- **North_Hospital (Surgeon) vs West_Hospital (Medical Secretary):** Surgeon is preferred over Medical Secretary, with anesthesic_patient preference over morning.
- **North-Hospital (Anesthesic Patient) vs East-Hospital (Afternoon):** Anesthesic_patient is superior to afternoon.
- **South-Hospital (Surgeons) dominate both West and East contexts, ensuring dominance.**
