### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2256;296;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for each prohibition support, there exists at least one corresponding permission support where the permission support strictly dominates the prohibition support. Domination means that every element in the permission support is preferred to at lease one element in the corresponding prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access to modify report6 using the move action is granted to Rachel_Baker. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**: The decision is based on the following relations and preferences: 
    * **Role Preferences**:
        *  Rachel_Baker is assigned the role of wp_leader in Institute3, which is preferred over the role of staff_member in Institute2.
        * Rachel_Baker is also assigned the roles of coordinator and researcher in University3, both preferred over staff_member and PhD_student in Institute2 respectively.
    *  **Context Preferences**:
       *  The context ""audit"" in Institute3 is preferred over ""collaboration"" in Institute2 for the move action on report6. 
       * The context ""management"" in University3 is also preferred to ""collaboration"" for the same action and report. 

   These preferences lead to the conclusion that Rachel_Baker's permissions in Institute3 and University3 dominate her prohibitions in Institute2, thus granting her access.

### Output:";2910;346;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support where the permission support dominates the prohibitions support. Domination means each element in the permission support is strictly preferable to or matches an element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access to perform the ""move"" activity on ""agreement4"" in the view ""WP5"" and ""WP1"" is granted to Wendy_Mitchell. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:  The decision is based on the comparison of supports for permissions and prohibitions, considering the preferences between roles, contexts, and other elements. Here's a breakdown:

    * **Role Preferences:**
        * Wendy_Mitchell's role as ""wp_leader"" in University2 is preferred over roles like ""associate_professor,"" ""post_doc,"" ""secondee,"" and ""PhD_student"" in University1 and Institute3.
        * Similarly, her role as ""team_leader"" at Institute3 is preferred over the roles mentioned above. 

    *  **Context Preferences:**
       *  The ""audit"" context in University2 takes precedence over the ""collaboration"" context used in University1.
       * The ""management"" context in Institute3 is also preferred over ""collaboration"" and ""default"" contexts.

   * **Matching Elements:** Some elements are identical in both permission and prohibition supports, such as the activity ""move"" and the object ""agreement4."" This doesn't require a preference comparison.


   As a result of these preferences, the permission supports consistently dominate the prohibition supports, satisfying the decision rule and granting access.

        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Input:1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if,         for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.         Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization University1 grants the role team_leader the Permission to perform the activity validate on the view secondment_report if the context audit holds,The organisation University1 employes Henry_Lee in the role team_leader, The organisation Consortium considers sign as a validate activity, The organisation University1 uses dataset2 in the view secondment_report, The context audit holds between Henry_Lee, sign, and dataset2 in the organisation University1,  
3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
(support 1): The organization Institute1 grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity validate on the view WP2 if the context collaboration holds,The organisation Institute1 employes Henry_Lee in the role staff_member, The organisation Consortium considers sign as a validate activity, The organisation Institute1 uses dataset2 in the view WP2, The context collaboration holds between Henry_Lee, sign, and dataset2 in the organisation Institute1,  
(support 2): The organization University3 grants the role post_doc the Prohibition to perform the activity validate on the view secondment_agreement if the context default holds,The organisation University3 employes Henry_Lee in the role post_doc, The organisation Consortium considers sign as a validate activity, The organisation University3 uses dataset2 in the view secondment_agreement, The context default holds between Henry_Lee, sign, and dataset2 in the organisation University3,  
4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation University1 employes Henry_Lee in the role team_leader, `` is preferred to ``The organisation Institute1 employes Henry_Lee in the role staff_member, `` because: team_leader is preferred to staff_member. 
The relation ``The context audit holds between Henry_Lee, sign, and dataset2 in the organisation University1, `` is preferred to ``The context collaboration holds between Henry_Lee, sign, and dataset2 in the organisation Institute1, `` because: audit is preferred to collaboration. 
The relation ``The organisation University1 employes Henry_Lee in the role team_leader, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University3 employes Henry_Lee in the role post_doc, `` because: team_leader is preferred to post_doc. 
The relation ``The context audit holds between Henry_Lee, sign, and dataset2 in the organisation University1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Henry_Lee, sign, and dataset2 in the organisation University3, `` because: audit is preferred to default. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Henry_Lee to perform sign on dataset2 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1656;384;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of permission support over prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: 
   The access to perform the ""sign"" activity on the ""dataset2"" in the ""secondment_report"" view is granted to Henry_Lee.

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    * **Role Preference**:
        * The permission is supported by Henry_Lee as a ""team_leader"" in the University1, which is preferred over the prohibition roles of ""staff_member"" (Institute1) and ""post_doc"" (University3). 
        * This preference is based on the organizational hierarchy, where team_leaders generally have higher authority than staff_members or post_docs.
    *  **Context Preference**:
       * The permission context is ""audit"" in University1, preferred over the ""collaboration"" context in Institute1 and the ""default"" context in University3. 
       * This preference reflects the sensitivity of the ""audit"" context, requiring stricter access control compared to ""collaboration"" or general ""default"" contexts.

    * **Element Matching**:
        All other elements in the permission and prohibition supports are identical:
        * Organization: Consortium
        * Activity: ""sign"" (considered equivalent to ""validate"" by the Consortium)
        * View: Secondment_report (permission) vs. WP2 (prohibition) and Secondment_agreement (prohibition).
        * Dataset: Dataset2


Since the permission support's role, context, and matching elements are all preferred to or equal to the prohibition supports, the access is granted according to the dominance rule.

### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member.

4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation University1 employes Xander_Rodriguez in the role full_professor, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University1 employes Xander_Rodriguez in the role associate_professor, `` because: full_professor is preferred to associate_professor.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1861;365;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of permission supports over prohibition supports. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: 
     Access is granted to Xander_Rodriguez for performing the activity ""ask"" on ""report2"" in the view ""WP2"".

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    * **Role Preference**:
        * The permission supports involving Xander_Rodriguez as a ""full_professor"" and ""team_leader"" are preferred over the prohibition support where he is an ""associate_professor"". 
        * This preference is based on the organization's hierarchy, where higher roles (full_professor, team_leader) have greater authority than lower roles (associate_professor).

    * **Context Preference**:
       * The context ""secondment"" in the granted permissions is preferred over the context ""collaboration"" in the prohibition.
       * Similarly, the context ""audit"" in another granted permission is preferred over ""collaboration"". 
       * These preferences reflect the organization’s policies, where specific contexts (""secondment"", ""audit"") allow for certain actions (""ask"", ""consult"") that are restricted in other contexts (""collaboration"").


    * **Element Matching**: 
      * All other elements (activity ""ask"", resource ""report2"", and the organization ""University1"") are identical in both the granted permissions and the prohibition. Therefore, no preference needs to be determined for these elements. 



    * **Dominance**: 
       Since the permission supports consistently dominate the prohibition support based on role and context preferences, access is ultimately granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2695;348;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for each prohibition support, there exists at least one corresponding permission support where the permission support's dominance over the prohibition support is established. Dominance is defined as each element in the permission support being strictly preferred to, or matching, at least one equivalent element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access to perform the ""sign"" activity on ""dataset2"" is granted to Olivia_Scott. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**: The decision is based on the analysis of multiple permission and prohibition supports, considering the preferences between roles, contexts, and other elements. 

    * **Role Preferences**:
        * Olivia_Scott's role as ""team_leader"" in the University2 context is preferred over her role as ""staff_member"" in the Institute2 context.
        * Her role as ""coordinator"" at the Institute2 is preferred over ""staff member"" and ""associate_professor"" roles within the same organization. 

     * **Context Preferences**:
         * The ""management"" context in University2 is preferred to the ""collaboration"" context in Institute2.
         * Both ""audit"" contexts (in both University2 and Institute2) are preferred to ""collaboration"" and ""default"" contexts. 

      * **Matching Elements**: Some elements, like the activity ""sign"" and the dataset ""dataset2,"" are consistent across both permissions and prohibitions, leading to no preference comparison needed.

    By analyzing these preferences, we find that for each prohibition, there is a corresponding permission with a dominant support. This satisfies the decision rule, leading to the granting of access.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

An access is granted if and only if,         for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.         Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization University1 grants the role coordinator the Permission to perform the activity consult on the view WP5 if the context management holds,The organisation University1 employes Quinn_Thomas in the role coordinator, The organisation Consortium considers cat as a consult activity, The organisation University1 uses agreement2 in the view WP5, The context management holds between Quinn_Thomas, cat, and agreement2 in the organisation University1,  
(support 2): The organization Institute1 grants the role full_professor the Permission to perform the activity consult on the view data if the context audit holds,The organisation Institute1 employes Quinn_Thomas in the role full_professor, The organisation Consortium considers cat as a consult activity, The organisation Institute1 uses agreement2 in the view data, The context audit holds between Quinn_Thomas, cat, and agreement2 in the organisation Institute1,  
3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support:

4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation University1 employes Quinn_Thomas in the role coordinator, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University1 employes Quinn_Thomas in the role PhD_student, `` because: coordinator is preferred to PhD_student. 
The relation ``The context management holds between Quinn_Thomas, cat, and agreement2 in the organisation University1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Quinn_Thomas, cat, and agreement2 in the organisation University1, `` because: management is preferred to default. 
The relation ``The organisation Institute1 employes Quinn_Thomas in the role full_professor, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University1 employes Quinn_Thomas in the role PhD_student, `` because: full_professor is preferred to PhD_student. 
The relation ``The context audit holds between Quinn_Thomas, cat, and agreement2 in the organisation Institute1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Quinn_Thomas, cat, and agreement2 in the organisation University1, `` because: audit is preferred to default. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Quinn_Thomas to perform cat on agreement2 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1640;413;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted based on the dominance of permission support over prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: 
The access to perform the ""cat"" activity on ""agreement2"" in the ""WP5"" view is granted to Quinn_Thomas.

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:

*   **Quinn_Thomas' Roles**:
    *   Quinn_Thomas holds the role ""coordinator"" at the ""University1"" (preferred over the ""PhD_student"" role at ""University1""). This preference stems from the hierarchical nature of roles, with ""coordinator"" being a higher-ranking position.
    *    Quinn_Thomas also holds the ""full_professor"" role at the ""Institute1"" (again, preferred over the ""student"" role).
*   **Contextual Preferences**:
     *   The ""management"" context in which Quinn_Thomas operates with ""cat"" and ""agreement2"", is preferred over the general ""default"" context.
     *    Similarly, the ""audit"" context is preferred over ""default"" in the case of Quinn_Thomas performing ""cat"" with ""agreement2"". 

* **Dominance Analysis**: 
    The permission supports for both ""WP5""(University1) and ""data"" (Institute1) are dominant over the prohibition support for ""internal_data"" (University1). This dominance arises because:
    * Quinn_Thomas' role as ""coordinator"" is preferred over his role as ""PhD student"".
    * The ""management"" and ""audit"" contexts are preferred over the default context.

Since the permission supports dominate the prohibition support based on role and context preferences, the access to perform ""cat"" is granted.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1646;375;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support according to the defined preferences. 
2.  **Outcome**: 
The access to perform the ""sign"" activity on the ""dataset1"" in the ""WP5"" view is granted to Eva_Clark. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:  
The decision is based on the following dominant relationships: 
*   **Role Preference**: 
    *   Eva_Clark is employed as a ""team_leader"" by ""University2"", which is preferred over her role as an ""associate_professor"" at ""Institute1"". This preference stems from the inherent hierarchy and responsibilities associated with these roles.
    *  Eva_Clark's role as a ""coordinator"" at  ""Institute1"" is also preferred to her role as ""associate professor"" at the same institution. 
*  **Context Preference**:
    * The ""audit"" context in which Eva_Clark operates at ""University2"" is preferred over the ""default"" context she operates in at ""Instance1"". This reflects a higher level of scrutiny and control associated with the audit context.
* **Other Elements**:  
    * Both permission and prohibition involve the same activity (""sign""), the same organization (""Consortium""), and the same dataset (""dataset1""). As these elements are identical, they do not contribute to the dominance comparison. 


As a result of these dominant relationships, the permission support outweighs the prohibition support, leading to the granting of access.

 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1451;386;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when, for every element supporting a prohibition,  there exists a corresponding element supporting a permission that dominates it. Dominance occurs when each element in the permission support strictly prefers at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: 
The access to perform the ""describe"" activity on ""agreement6"" within the ""WP4"" view is granted to Amelia_King.

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:

*   **Role Preference**:
    *   The permission support states: ""The organization University3 employs Amelia_King as a full_professor."" 
    *    The prohibition support states:  ""The organization Institute2 employs Amelia King as an associate_professor.""
    *     Since ""full_professor"" is preferred to ""associate_professor"", this preference favors the permission. 

*    **Context Preference**:
     * The permission support indicates: ""The context 'secondment' holds between Amelia King, 'describe', and 'agreement6' in the organization University3."" 
     *  The prohibition support indicates:  "" The context 'default' holds between  Amelia King,  'describe', and  'agreement6'  in the organization Institute2.""
     *   Because ""secondment"" is preferred over ""default"", this preference also favors the permission grant. 

 *   **Shared Elements**: Both the permission and prohibition support share the following elements:
    * The organization Consortium considers ""describe"" as a ""consult"" activity.
    *  The organization Consortium uses  ""agreement6"" in the view ""WP4"".
    * Since these elements are identical in both supports, they do not contribute to dominance.



As both role and context preferences favor the permission, the access is granted according to the decision rule.

        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2289;730;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for each prohibition support, there exists at least one corresponding permission support where the permission support's dominance over the prohibition support is established. Dominance is achieved when each element in the permission support strictly prefers at least one equivalent element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access to perform the ""grep"" activity on ""report7"" is granted.  

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:  The decision is based on a comparison of permissions and prohibitions, considering the roles, contexts, and their relative preferences. Here's a breakdown:

    * **Permission 1 (University1):**
        * Role: Coordinator
        * Context: Audit
        * This permission is preferred over the prohibitions because:
            * ""Coordinator"" is preferred to ""staff_member"", ""secondee"", and ""PhD_student"".
            * The ""audit"" context is preferred to the ""default"" context.
    * **Prohibition 1 (Institute3):**
       * Role: Staff_member
       * Context: Default
       * This prohibition is dominated by Permission 1 due to the preference of ""Coordinator"" over ""Staff_member"" and ""audit"" over ""default"".
    *  **Prohibition 2 (University2):**
         * Role: Secondee
         * Context:Default
         * This prohibition also falls under the dominance of Permission 1 for the same reasons as Prohibition 1. 
    *   **Prohibition3 (University1)**
         *Role: PhD_student
         *Context: Default
         * Similar to the previous prohibitions, Permission 1 dominates this one due to the role and context preferences. 

     * **Other Permissions:**
         * Permission 2 from University2 is also relevant but doesn't directly conflict with any prohibitions in this analysis.



Let me know if you have any other questions.
<h2>Explanation of the Decision-Making Process</h2>

The access decision is made based on a set of rules that compare permissions and prohibitions. 

**Here's a step-by-step breakdown:**

1. **Identify Permissions and Prohibitions:** The system first identifies all granted permissions and prohibitions related to the user (Yara_Lee) and the requested action (grep on report7).

2. **Compare Supports:** Each permission and prohibition has a set of supporting elements (role, context, etc.). The system compares these elements to determine dominance.

3. **Dominance Rule:** A permission dominates a prohibition if each element in its support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibitions support.

4. **Preference Hierarchy:** The system uses a predefined hierarchy of preferences to determine which elements are more desirable. For example, ""Coordinator"" role is preferred over ""Staff Member"" role. Similarly, ""Audit"" context is favored over ""Default"" context.

5. **Decision Outcome:** If a permission dominates all relevant prohibitions, the access request is granted. Otherwise, it is denied.

**In this specific case:**

* Yara Lee has a permission granted by University1 (Coordinator role, Audit context) which dominates the prohibitions issued by Institute3, University2, and University1 themselves. 
* This dominance is established due to the higher preference for the Coordinator role and the Audit context compared to the roles and contexts associated with the prohibitions.

Therefore, Yara Lee is granted access to perform ""grep"" on ""Report7"".

 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2874;372;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support where the permission’s support dominantes the prohibition’s support.  Dominance means each element in the permission support must be strictly preferred to *at least one* element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access is granted for Isla Martin to perform the ""edit"" activity on ""dataset8"". 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**: 

    * **Role Preference:**
        *  Isla Martin is employed as a ""wp_leader"" by the University1, which is preferred to the ""post_doc"" role held by Isla Martin at Institute3 (prohibition). 
        * Isla Martin is also a ""coordinator"" at Institute3, Institute2, and is preferred to ""staff_member"" roles at Institute3. 
    * **Context Preference:**
       * The ""secondment"" context holds for Isla Martin's actions on dataset8 at University1, while the ""collaboration"" context applies in the prohibition at Institute3 –  ""secondment"" is preferred.
       * Similarly, the ""audit"" context at Institute3 is preferred to both ""default"" and ""collaboration"" contexts in the prohibitions. 
       *  The ""management"" context in Institute2 is preferred over ""default"" in the prohibition. 


    * **Other Elements:** All other elements in the permission and prohibition supports are identical (e.g., ""edit"" is considered a ""modify"" activity, ""dataset8"" is used in both views). Therefore, no preference comparisons are needed for these elements.

    Because the permission supports dominate the prohibition supports in all relevant aspects (role, context), access is granted to Isla Martin.

        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Input:1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if,         for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.         Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports:

4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation University1 employes Ben_Foster in the role full_professor, `` is preferred to ``The organisation Institute3 employes Ben_Foster in the role secondee, `` because: full_professor is preferred to secondee. 
The relation ``The context secondment holds between Ben_Foster, sign, and report5 in the organisation University1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Ben_Foster, sign, and report5 in the organisation Institute3, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
The relation ``The organisation University1 employes Ben_Foster in the role full_professor, `` is preferred to ``The organisation Institute3 employes Ben_Foster in the role staff_member, `` because: full_professor is preferred to staff_member. 
The relation ``The context secondment holds between Ben_Foster, sign, and report5 in the organisation University1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Ben_Foster, sign, and report5 in the organisation Institute3, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
The relation ``The organisation University1 employes Ben_Foster in the role full_professor, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University2 employes Ben_Foster in the role post_doc, `` because: full_professor is preferred to post_doc. 
The relation ``The context secondment holds between Ben_Foster, sign, and report5 in the organisation University1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Ben_Foster, sign, and report5 in the organisation University2, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
The relation ``The organisation University3 employes Ben_Foster in the role team_leader, `` is preferred to ``The organisation Institute3 employes Ben_Foster in the role secondee, `` because: team_leader is preferred to secondee. 
The relation ``The context secondment holds between Ben_Foster, sign, and report5 in the organisation University3, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Ben_Foster, sign, and report5 in the organisation Institute3, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
The relation ``The organisation University3 employes Ben_Foster in the role team_leader, `` is preferred to ``The organisation Institute3 employes Ben_Foster in the role staff_member, `` because: team_leader is preferred to staff_member.

 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2294;428;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for each prohibition support, there exists at least one corresponding permission support where the permission support's dominance over the prohibition support is established. Dominance is achieved when each element in the permission support strictly prefers at least one counterpart element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access to perform the ""sign"" activity on ""report5"" is granted to Ben_Foster. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:  
    * **Permissions:**
        * **University1:** Grants Ben_Foster (full_professor) permission to ""sign"" report5 on WP2 under the ""secondment"" context. This permission is preferred over the prohibitions due to:
            * **Role Preference:** ""full_professor"" is preferred over ""secondee"" (Institute3 prohibition) and ""staff_member"" (both Institute3 and University3 prohibitions), ""post_doc"" (University2 prohibition), and ""team_leader"" (University3 prohibition).
            *  **Context Preference:**  ""secondment"" is preferred to ""default"" (in all prohibition contexts).
        *  **University3:** Grants Ben Foster (team_leader) permission to  ""sign"" on report5 in WP3 under ""secondment"". This permission is also preferred due to the same role and context preferences as above. 

    * **Prohibitions:** 
       * **Institute3:** 
           * Grants a prohibition to Ben Foster (secondee) from ""signing"" on WP5 under the ""default"" context.
           * Also prohibits Ben Foster (staff_member) on WP3 and WP5 under ""default"".
       *   **University2:** Prohibits Ben Foster (post_doc) from signing on ""public_data"" under ""default.""

    *  **Dominance:** The University1 and University3 permissions dominate all relevant prohibitions due to the preferred roles and contexts.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1446;326;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support according to the defined preferences. 
2.  **Outcome**: 
   The access to perform the ""list"" activity on ""deliverable1"" in the ""WP3"" view is granted to Paul_Harris. 
3.  **Relations and  Preferences**: 
     * **Role Preference**: The permission support states that Paul_Harris is employed as a ""wp_leader"" by the ""University1"", while the prohibition support states he is a ""secondee"" at ""Institute2"". 
     ""wp_Leader"" is strictly preferred over ""secondee"", meaning this role preference favors the permission. 
    * **Context Preference**:  The permission support indicates the ""audit"" context, while the prohibition mentions the ""collaboration"" context. ""audit"" is preferred over ""collaboration"", further favoring the permission.
    *  **Shared Elements**: Both the permission and prohibition agree on the activity (""list""), the organization (""Consortium""), and the deliverable (""deliverable1""). Since these elements are identical, they don't contribute to dominance. 

    **Conclusion**: Because both the role preference and the context preference favor the permission support, the access is granted according to the dominance rule.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization Institute1 grants the role team_leader the Permission to perform the activity consult on the view WP1 if the context secondment holds,The organisation Institute1 employes Frank_Harris in the role team_leader, The organisation Consortium considers ask as a consult activity, The organisation Institute1 uses dataset3 in the view WP1, The context secondment holds between Frank_Harris, ask, and dataset3 in the organisation Institute1,  
3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
(support 1): The organization Institute1 grants the role secondee the Prohibition to perform the activity consult on the view contracts if the context default holds,The organisation Institute1 employes Frank_Harris in the role secondee, The organisation Consortium considers ask as a consult activity, The organisation Institute1 uses dataset3 in the view contracts, The context default holds between Frank_Harris, ask, and dataset3 in the organisation Institute1,  
4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation Institute1 employes Frank_Harris in the role team_leader, `` is preferred to ``The organisation Institute1 employes Frank_Harris in the role secondee, `` because: team_leader is preferred to secondee. 
The relation ``The context secondment holds between Frank_Harris, ask, and dataset3 in the organisation Institute1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Frank_Harris, ask, and dataset3 in the organisation Institute1, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Frank_Harris to perform ask on dataset3 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1441;396;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support according to the defined preferences. 
2.  **Outcome**:  
    The access to perform the ""consult"" activity (specifically ""ask"") on ""dataset3"" within the ""WP1"" view is granted to Frank_Harris. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    *   **Role Preference**: The permission support specifies Frank_Harris as a ""team_leader"", while the prohibition support designates him as a ""secondee"". 
        *   ""team_leader"" is preferred over ""secondee"" according to the established preferences. This preference favors the permission over the prohibition. 
    *  **Context Preference**: The context for the permission is ""secondment"", while the context for the prohibition is ""default"".
        *  ""secondment"" is preferred to ""default"". This preference further strengthens the dominance argument in favor of the permission.
    * **Other Shared Elements**: Both the permission and prohibition support share the following elements:
        * The organization ""Institute1"" grants both roles.
        * ""ask"" is considered a ""consult"" type activity by the ""Consortium"".
        *""dataset3"" is used in the specified view (""WP1"" for permission, ""contracts"" for prohibition).
        * Since these elements are identical in both supports, they do not contribute to the dominance comparison. 

    **Conclusion**: Because the permission support's role and context are both strictly preferred to the prohibition support's corresponding elements, the access is granted according to the dominance-based decision rule.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2060;366;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates it. Dominance is achieved when each element in the permission support is preferred to, or matches, at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access to perform the ""copy"" activity on ""dataset6"" is granted to Paul_Harris. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    * **Role Preference:**
        * The permission support states that Paul_Harris holds the role ""full_professor"" in the organization ""University1"", which is preferred over the roles ""secondee"" (in Institute1), ""post_doc"" (in University3), or ""staff_member"" (also in University3). This preference directly impacts the comparison between the permission and prohibition supports. 

    * **Context Preference:**
       * The permission context is ""audit"" within University1, which is preferred to the ""default"" context used in several prohibition supports (Institute1, University3). 
       * Similarly, ""audit"" is preferred to ""collaboration"" (University3) and ""default"" (again, University3), further strengthening the dominance of the permission support. 


    * **Element Matching:**
        The remaining elements (activity ""copy"", dataset ""dataset6"", and the organization ""Consortium"") are identical in both the permission and various prohibition supports. This means they contribute equally to the dominance comparison. 

**Conclusion:** Due to the preferred role (""full_professor"") and preferred context (""audit""), the permission support clearly dominates the prohibition supports, leading to the granting of access.

### Output:";2266;423;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for each prohibition support, there exists at least one corresponding permission support where the permission support strictly dominates the prohibition support. Domination occurs when each element in the permission support is preferred to, or matches, a corresponding element in the prohibition support based on the defined preferences. 
2.  **Outcome**: The access to perform the ""modify"" activity (specifically ""add"") on the ""agreement3"" object within the ""WP4"" view is granted to Frank_Harris. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    *   **Role Preferences**:
        *   The roles ""researcher"" and ""full_professor"" are preferred over ""secondee"", ""post_doc"", and ""associate_professor"". This preference is based on the organization's hierarchy and the perceived level of responsibility associated with each role. 
    *  **Context Preferences**:
       *   The ""audit"" context is preferred over the ""collaboration"" context. This indicates that activities performed under the audit context are considered more critical and require stricter access control.
    * **Element Matching**: Some elements in both permission and prohibition supports are identical (e.g., ""add"" as modify activity, ""agreement3""). These matching elements do not contribute to dominance but are still considered part of the overall support.

    **How the Decision Was Reached**:

    The decision was reached by comparing each prohibition support with the corresponding permission supports. 

    *   For the prohibition related to ""secondment_report"" (University3), the permission granted by Institute3 (""researcher"" + ""audit"") dominates due to the preferred role (""researcher"") and preferred context (""audit"").
    *    For the prohibitions related to ""public_data"" (Institute1) and ""WP2"" (University1), the permissions granted by Institute2 and Institute3 respectively, also dominate based on the preferred role and context.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization Institute2 grants the role team_leader the Permission to perform the activity consult on the view confidential_data if the context management holds,The organisation Institute2 employes Zane_Gonzalez in the role team_leader, The organisation Consortium considers grep as a consult activity, The organisation Institute2 uses report3 in the view confidential_data, The context management holds between Zane_Gonzalez, grep, and report3 in the organisation Institute2,  
(support 2): The organization University3 grants the role full_professor the Permission to perform the activity consult on the view WP2 if the context audit holds,The organisation University3 employes Zane_Gonzalez in the role full_professor, The organisation Consortium considers grep as a consult activity, The organisation University3 uses report3 in the view WP2, The context audit holds between Zane_Gonzalez, grep, and report3 in the organisation University3,  
3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
(support 1): The organization University1 grants the role PhD_student the Prohibition to perform the activity consult on the view WP4 if the context collaboration holds,The organisation University1 employes Zane_Gonzalez in the role PhD_student, The organisation Consortium considers grep as a consult activity, The organisation University1 uses report3 in the view WP4, The context collaboration holds between Zane_Gonzalez, grep, and report3 in the organisation University1,  
4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation Institute2 employes Zane_Gonzalez in the role team_leader, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University1 employes Zane_Gonzalez in the role PhD_student, `` because: team_leader is preferred to PhD_student. 
The relation ``The context management holds between Zane_Gonzalez, grep, and report3 in the organisation Institute2, `` is preferred to ``The context collaboration holds between Zane_Gonzalez, grep, and report3 in the organisation University1, `` because: management is preferred to collaboration. 
The relation ``The organisation University3 employes Zane_Gonzalez in the role full_professor, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University1 employes Zane_Gonzalez in the role PhD_student, `` because: full_professor is preferred to PhD_student. 
The relation ``The context audit holds between Zane_Gonzalez, grep, and report3 in the organisation University3, `` is preferred to ``The context collaboration holds between Zane_Gonzalez, grep, and report3 in the organisation University1, `` because: audit is preferred to collaboration. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Zane_Gonzalez to perform grep on report3 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1650;307;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support according to the defined preferences. 
2.  **Outcome**:  
    The access to perform the ""grep"" activity on ""report3"" is granted to Zane_Gonzalez. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    *   **Role Preference**:
        *   The permission supports include roles ""team_leader"" and ""full_professor"", which are both preferred to the prohibition role ""PhD_student"". This preference is based on the organization's hierarchy and responsibilities. 
    *  **Context Preference**:
       *   Both permission contexts (""management"" and ""audit"") are preferred over the prohibition context (""collaboration""). This preference reflects the higher level of control and scrutiny associated with management and audit contexts compared to collaboration.
    * **Other Elements**: All other elements (activity ""grep"", resource ""report3"", and the organization ""Consortium"") are identical in both the permission and prohibition supports. Therefore, they do not contribute to the dominance comparison.

    Since the permission supports dominate the prohibition supports in terms of both role and context preferences, the access is granted according to the decision rule.

### Output:";1652;296;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of permission support over prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**:
    The access to perform the ""select"" activity on ""dataset2"" is granted to Quinn_Thomas. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    * **Role Preference:**
        * Both permission grants (from University1 and Institute2) assign Quinn_Thomas the role ""full_professor,"" which is strictly preferred over the ""associate_professor"" role in the prohibition grant from University1. 

    * **Context Preference:**
       * The ""audit"" context in the University1 permission grant is preferred to the ""collaboration"" context in University1's prohibition grant. 
       * Similarly, the ""management"" context in Institute2's permission grant is also preferred to ""collaboration"" in the prohibition. 

   * **Activity & Dataset Consistency:** 
      * All grants involve the activity ""select"" and the dataset ""dataset2,"" ensuring consistency across permissions and prohibitions.


    Since both role and context preferences favor the permission grants over the prohibition, the access is granted according to the dominance rule.

**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Mia_Anderson to perform read on dataset9 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2683;425;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates it. Dominance is achieved when each element in the permission support is preferred to or matches at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access to perform the ""read"" activity on ""dataset9"" is granted to Mia_Anderson. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:  The decision is based on comparing the supports of various permissions and prohibitions. Here's a breakdown:

    * **Permissions:**
        * **Permission 1:** Granted by Institute1, role ""coordinator"", context ""audit"". This permission is preferred over the prohibitions because:
            *  ""coordinator"" is preferred to ""post_doc"", ""secondee"", and ""PhD_student"" roles in the prohibitions.
            * ""audit"" context is preferred over ""default"" context in all relevant prohibitions.

        * **Permissions 2 & 3:**  Granted by Institute1 (role ""team_leader"") and University3 (role ""researcher"") respectively, both with context ""audit"" and ""secondment"" respectively. These permissions also dominate the relevant prohibitions based on the same reasoning as Permission 1. 


    * **Prohibitions:** 
       * **Prohibition 1 & 2:** Granted by Institutes3 and University3 respectively, with roles ""postdoc"" and ""secondee"" and context ""default"". These prohibitions are dominated by the permissions granted by Institute1 and University3 due to the preference for higher roles and ""audit""/""secondment"" contexts.

       *  **Prohibition 3:** Granted by University3, with role ""PhD student"" and context  ""default"". This prohibition is also dominated by the permission granted by University3 with the ""researcher"" role and context ""secondment"".




    Therefore, all prohibitions are outweighed by at least one permission, satisfying the decision rule and granting Mia_Anderson access to ""read"" ""dataset9"".

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1865;322;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for every prohibition support, there exists at least one corresponding permission support where the permission support strictly dominates the prohibition support. Domination means each element in the permission support must be strictly preferred to *at least one* element in the corresponding prohibition support.

2.  **Outcome**: The access to perform ""grep"" on ""report5"" within the view ""WP5"" is granted to Rachel_Baker.

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:

    *   **Permission Support:**
        *   **Role Assignment:** The organization ""Institute2"" employs Rachel_Baker as a ""team_leader"". This is preferred over the roles assigned in the prohibition supports (PhD_student, associate_professor).
        *    **Context:** The context ""secondment"" holds between Rachel Baker, ""grep"", and ""report5"", within ""Institute2"". This context is preferred over ""default"" in all prohibition supports.

    *  **Prohibition Supports:** There are three prohibition supports, each originating from a different organization (""Institute1"", ""University3"", ""University2"") and assigning Rachel_Baker the role of ""PhD_student"" or ""associate_professor"". All prohibition supports share the same context (""default"") and the same activity (""grep"") and object (""report5""). However, they are all outweighed by the permission support due to the preferred role (""team_leader"") and preferred context (""secondment"").

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:

    *   **University1 Permission vs. Institute1 Prohibition**:
        *   The University1 permission grants Mia_Anderson the role ""team_leader"" with the context ""secondment"" to perform ""sign"" on ""agreement2"". This is preferred over the Institute1 prohibition granting Mia_Anderson ""PhD_student"" with ""collaboration"" context to perform ""validate"" on ""WP4"". 
            *   **Role Preference**: ""Team_leader"" is preferred over ""PhD_Student"".
            *    **Context Preference**: ""Secondment"" is preferred to ""Collaboration"".
    *    **Institute2 Researcher Permission vs.  Institute2 Associate Professor Prohibition:**
        *    The Institute2 researcher permission grants ""Mia_Anderson"" the role ""researcher"" with ""management"" context to sign ""agreement2"", which is preferred to the Institute2 associate professor prohibition granting her the role ""associate_professor"" with ""collaboraton"" context to ""validate"" ""secondment_agreement"". 
           *    **Role Preference:** ""Researcher"" is preffered to ""Associate Professor"".
           *   **Context Preference:** ""Management"" is preferred  to ""Collaboration"".

    * **Overall Dominance**: Both permission supports dominate their corresponding prohibition supports based on the role and context preferences.



Therefore, based on the defined logic and preferences, Mia_Anderson's access is granted to perform the 'sign' activity on the 'agreement2' view.

        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Input:1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if,         for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.         Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization University2 grants the role team_leader the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view contracts if the context audit holds,The organisation University2 employes Mia_Anderson in the role team_leader, The organisation Consortium considers create as a modify activity, The organisation University2 uses dataset6 in the view contracts, The context audit holds between Mia_Anderson, create, and dataset6 in the organisation University2,  
3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
(support 1): The organization University3 grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view internal_data if the context default holds,The organisation University3 employes Mia_Anderson in the role staff_member, The organisation Consortium considers create as a modify activity, The organisation University3 uses dataset6 in the view internal_data, The context default holds between Mia_Anderson, create, and dataset6 in the organisation University3,  
4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation University2 employes Mia_Anderson in the role team_leader, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University3 employes Mia_Anderson in the role staff_member, `` because: team_leader is preferred to staff_member. 
The relation ``The context audit holds between Mia_Anderson, create, and dataset6 in the organisation University2, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Mia_Anderson, create, and dataset6 in the organisation University3, `` because: audit is preferred to default. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Mia_Anderson to perform create on dataset6 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1443;345;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support according to the defined preferences. 
2.  **Outcome**:  
    The access to perform the ""create"" activity on ""dataset6"" is granted to Mia_Anderson. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    * **Role Preference**: The permission support states that Mia_Anderson is employed as a ""team_leader"" by University2, while the prohibition support states she is a ""staff_member"" at University3.  ""team leader"" is preferred over ""staff member"" according to the provided preferences. This preference favors the permission.

    * **Context Preference**: The context for the permission is ""audit"" within University2, whereas the prohibition context is ""default"" within University3. ""audit"" is preferred to ""default"" based on the given preferences, further favoring the permission.


    * **Shared Elements**: Both the permission and prohibition support share the following elements:
        * The organization Consortium considers ""create"" as a ""modify"" activity.
        * Both organizations use ""dataset6"".

    Since these elements are identical in both supports, they do not contribute to dominance. 

    **Conclusion**: Because the permission support's role and context are both preferred to the prohibition support's, the permission dominates the prohibition, leading to the granting of access.

        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically:

        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share:

4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation University2 employes Rachel_Baker in the role full_professor, `` is preferred to ``The organisation Institute2 employes Rachel_Baker in the role staff_member, `` because: full_professor is preferred to staff_member. 
The relation ``The context audit holds between Rachel_Baker, drop, and report2 in the organisation University2, `` is preferred to ``The context collaboration holds between Rachel_Baker, drop, and report2 in the organisation Institute2, `` because: audit is preferred to collaboration.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1646;359;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches an element in the prohibition support across all relevant aspects (role, context, activity, resource). 

2.  **Outcome**: 
The access to perform the ""drop"" activity on ""report2"" within the ""WP4"" view is granted to Rachel_Baker. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
   * **Role Preference**:
      * The permission support indicates Rachel_Baker is a ""full_professor"" at ""University2"", which is preferred over the ""staff_member"" role at ""Institute2"" and the ""post_doc"" role at  ""Institute3"". This preference is based on the inherent hierarchy of academic roles.

   * **Context Preference**: 
      *  The ""audit"" context in ""University2"" is preferred over both the ""collaboration"" context in both ""Institutes2"" and ""Institute3"". The audit context implies a more formal and controlled environment, potentially requiring stricter access controls. 

   *  **Activity & Resource Consistency**: 
       * Both the permission and prohibition support agree on the activity (""drop"") and the resource (""report2"") within the view (""WP4"" for permission, ""WP2"" for prohibition, and ""reports"" for the other prohibition). This consistency strengthens the dominance argument.

**Conclusion**: 
Because the permission support's role, context, and activity/resource elements are all strictly preferred or equal to those in the prohibition supports, the access is granted according to the dominance rule.

### Output:";1431;364;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when, for every element supporting a prohibition,  there exists a corresponding element supporting a permission that dominates it. Dominance occurs when each element in the permission support is strictly preferable to *at least one* element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: 
The access is GRANTED. Ursula_Carter is permitted to perform the ""read"" activity on ""report7"" within the ""deliverables"" view. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
   * **Role Preference**: 
      * Permission Support: The organization ""University1"" employs Ursula_Carter as a ""researcher"".
      * Prohibition Support:  The organization ""Institute2"" employs Ursula Carter as a ""post_doc"".
      
      * **Reason**: ""Researcher"" is preferred over ""Post_doc"" in this context.

   * **Context Preference**:
      *  Permission Support: The context ""audit"" holds between Ursula Carter, ""read"", and ""report7"", within ""University1"".
     * Prohibition Support : The context ""default"" holds  between Ursula Carter,  ""read"", and  ""report7"" , within ""Institute2"".
     
     *  **Reason**: ""Audit"" is preferred to ""default"" in this scenario. 

   *  **Shared Elements**: Both the permission and prohibition support share:
      * The organization ""Consortium"" considers ""read"" as a ""consult"" activity.
      * Both use ""report7"". 


Since the researcher role and the audit context are preferred over the post_doc role and the default context, respectively, the permission dominates the prohibition, granting Ursula_Carter access.

 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1642;361;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches an element in the prohibition support according to the defined preferences. 
2.  **Outcome**: 
The access to perform the ""describe"" activity on ""agreement5"" is granted to Chloe_Walker. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
*   **Role Preference**: 
    *   The organization University3 employs Chloe_Walker as a ""researcher"", which is preferred over the ""post_doc"" role assigned by the organization Institute2. 
    
    *  The organization university3 employs chloe_walker as a ""coordinator"", which is also preferred to the ""post doc"" role. 
 *   **Context Preference**:
     *   The ""secondment"" context in the University3 environment is preferred over ""default"" in the Institute2 environment. 
     *  The ""management"" context in University3 is preferred to ""default"" context in Institute2.

*   **Activity & Object Consistency**: Both the permission and prohibition involve the same activity (""describe"") and the same object (""agreement5""). This consistency eliminates the need for separate preference comparisons for these elements.

**Conclusion**: Since the researcher and coordinator roles in University3 are preferred over the post_doc role in Institute2, and the ""secondment/management"" contexts are preferred over ""Default"", the permission to describe agreement5 is considered dominant over the prohibition. As a result, Chloe_Walker is granted access.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2268;411;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for each prohibition support, there exists at least one corresponding permission support where the permission support's dominance over the prohibition support is established. Dominance is achieved when each element in the permission support strictly prefers at least one counterpart element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access to perform the ""read"" activity on ""agreement1"" is granted to Ben_Foster. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**: The decision is based on comparing the supports of permissions and prohibitions, considering the preferences between roles, contexts, and other elements. 

    * **Permission Supports:**
        * **University1:** Grants Ben_Foster (team_leader) permission to read agreement1 in ""management"" context. This is preferred over the prohibitions from University2 and Institute2 due to the higher preference for ""team_leader"" over ""post_doc"" and ""staff_member"" roles, and ""management"" over ""collaboration"" and ""default"" contexts. 

        * **Institute3:** Also grants Ben_Foster (""coordinator"") permission to read ""agreement1"". This is preferred due to ""coordinator"" being more preferred than ""staff member"" in both Institute2 and Institute1. 

   * **Prohibition Supports:**
       * **University2:** Prohibits Ben_Foster as a ""post doc"" from reading ""WP1"" in the ""collaboration"" context. 
       *  **Institute2:**  Prohibits Ben_ Foster as a ""staff member"", from reading ""internal_data"" in the  ""collaboration"" context .
       *   **Institute1:** Prohibits  Ben_Foster as ""staff member,"" from reading  ""internal_data,"" in the ""default"" context.


   * **Dominance:** Each prohibition is countered by at least one permission with a more preferred role, context, or both. This satisfies the dominance condition, leading to the granting of access.

### Output:";1443;312;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when, for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates it. Dominance occurs when each element in the permission support is more preferred than at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support.

2.  **Outcome**: 
The access to perform the ""drop"" activity on ""report3"" within the ""WP5"" view is granted to Liam_Taylor.

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:

*   **Role Preference**: The permission support states that Liam_Taylor is employed as a ""team_leader"" by the ""Institute2"", while the prohibition support indicates Liam_Taylor as a ""post_doc"" in ""Institute3"".  ""Team_leader"" is strictly preferred over ""post doc"" in this context.
*   **Context Preference**:  The permission support specifies the ""audit"" context, while the prohibition uses the ""default"" context. ""Audit"" is preferred over ""default"" in this scenario.

* **Shared Elements**: Both the permission and prohibition support share:
    *   The organization ""Consortium"" considers ""drop"" as a ""modify"" activity.
    *  The organization ""Institute2"" and ""Institute3"" both use  ""report3"" in their respective views (""WP5"" and ""WP1"").


Since the permission support's role and context are both more preferred than the prohibition support's, the access is granted according to the decision rule.

**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Nathan_White to perform copy on dataset10 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1842;406;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of permission supports over prohibition supports.  A permission support dominates a prohibition support if every element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: 
   Access is granted to Nathan_White for performing the ""copy"" activity on ""dataset10"" within the ""administration"" and ""confidential_data"" views. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    * **Role Preferences**:
        * Nathan_White is employed as a ""coordinator"" and ""researcher"" in the organization Institute3, which are both preferred roles compared to the ""secondee"" role associated with the prohibition.

    * **Context Preferences**:
       * The ""audit"" context is preferred over the ""collaboration"" context. This preference applies to both the permission and prohibition scenarios involving Nathan_White. 
       * Additionally, the ""secondment"" context is also preferred over ""collaboration"" in the case of Nathan_White's researcher role.


    * **Dominance Analysis**:
        Let's analyze how the permissions dominate the prohibition:

        * **Permission (administration view):**
            * Role: Coordinator (preferred over secondee)
            * Context: Audit (preferred over collaboration)
            
        * **Prohibition (WP2 view):** 
           * Role: Secondee (less preferred)
           * Context: Collaboration (less preferred than audit)

        Since the permission support's role and context are both preferred to the prohibition support's, the permission dominates the prohibition, granting access.

        Similarly, for the ""confidential data"" view, the researcher role and ""audit/secondment"" contexts are preferred, leading to dominance and access being granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Amelia_King to perform edit on deliverable1 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2752;525;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for each prohibition support, there exists at least one corresponding permission support where the permission support's dominance over the prohibition support is established. Dominance is achieved when each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access to modify deliverable1 on the specified views (WP1, WP4, and reports) is granted to Amelia_King. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**: The decision is based on the comparison of various elements within the permission and prohibition supports:

    * **Role Preference**:  Amelia_King holds the role of ""full_professor"" in the University1 and Institute1, which is preferred over roles like ""associate_professor"", ""post_doc"", and ""PhD_student"". This preference is crucial in determining which permissions and prohibitions apply to her. 
    * **Context Preference**: The ""audit"" context is preferred over the ""collaboration"" context. This means that permissions granted under ""audit"" take precedence over those granted under ""collaboration"".

    Let's break down how these preferences lead to the granted access:

     * **University1 Permissions vs. University1 Prohibitions**: 
         * Amelia_King's role as ""full professor"" in University1, combined with the ""audit""  context, grants her permission to modify ""deliverable1"" on the ""WP1"" and ""WP4"" views. 
          * There are prohibitions against modifying ""public_data"" in the ""University1"" context under ""collaboration"", but these don't apply because the context is different (""audit"" vs. ""collaboration""). 
     * **Institute1 Permissions vs Institute1 Prohibitions:**
         * Similarly, her role and the ""secondment"" context (preferred over ""collaboration"") allow her to modify ""Deliverable1""  on the ""reports"" view in Institute1.
         * The prohibition against modifying ""WP3"" under ""collaboration"" in Institute3 doesn't apply due to the different context and the preference for ""secondment"".

    *  **No Overlapping Prohibitions**: There are no prohibitions that directly overlap with the granted permissions in terms of both role, context, and the specific view and deliverable.



Therefore, based on the established decision rule and the comparison of preferences, Amelia_King is granted access.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2278;475;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for each prohibition support, there exists at least one corresponding permission support where the permission support's dominance over the prohibition support is established. Dominance is achieved when each element in the permission support strictly prefers at least one equivalent element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access is granted, allowing Wendy Mitchell to perform the ""create"" activity on ""dataset4"" within the ""WP4"" view. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:  The decision hinges on the comparison of permission and prohibition supports across various organizations, roles, contexts, and activities. Here's a breakdown:

    * **University3 Permission vs. University1 Prohibitions:**
        * The University3 permission grants Wendy Mitchell as a ""wp_leader"" the right to ""modify"" (which includes ""create"") in ""WP4"", under the ""audit"" context.
        * University1 prohibitions target Wendy Mitchell in roles like ""secondee"" and ""associate_professor"" for ""modify"" in views like ""public_data"" under the ""collaboration"" context. These prohibitions are not directly comparable to the University3 permission due to differing roles, views, and contexts.

    *  **University1 Permission vs. Other University Prohibitions:** 
       * University1 also grants Wendy Mitchell a ""wp leader"" permission in ""reports"" under ""audit"". This permission is not directly relevant to the disputed ""create"" action on ""WP4"".
       *  University2 prohibits ""modify"" for Wendy Mitchell as an ""associate professor"" in ""view WP4"" under ""collaboration"". Again, this is not directly comparable due to different roles and contexts.


    * **Dominance:** The key factor is the preference for ""audit"" over ""collaboration"" contexts. This preference, combined with the higher-ranking role of ""wp leader"", establishes dominance over the University1 and University2 prohibitions. 


**In essence, the decision is based on the following:**

* Wendy Mitchell holds a more privileged role (""wp_leader"") in University3.
* The context of ""audit"" is preferred over ""collaboration"".
* These factors outweigh the prohibitions imposed by other universities and roles.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization Institute3 grants the role researcher the Permission to perform the activity consult on the view public_data if the context audit holds,The organisation Institute3 employes Chloe_Walker in the role researcher, The organisation Consortium considers select as a consult activity, The organisation Institute3 uses report7 in the view public_data, The context audit holds between Chloe_Walker, select, and report7 in the organisation Institute3,  
3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support:

4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation Institute3 employes Chloe_Walker in the role researcher, `` is preferred to ``The organisation Institute2 employes Chloe_Walker in the role post_doc, `` because: researcher is preferred to post_doc. 
The relation ``The context audit holds between Chloe_Walker, select, and report7 in the organisation Institute3, `` is preferred to ``The context collaboration holds between Chloe_Walker, select, and report7 in the organisation Institute2, `` because: audit is preferred to collaboration. 
The relation ``The organisation Institute3 employes Chloe_Walker in the role researcher, `` is preferred to ``The organisation Institute2 employes Chloe_Walker in the role secondee, `` because: researcher is preferred to secondee. 
The relation ``The context audit holds between Chloe_Walker, select, and report7 in the organisation Institute3, `` is preferred to ``The context collaboration holds between Chloe_Walker, select, and report7 in the organisation Institute2, `` because: audit is preferred to collaboration. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Chloe_Walker to perform select on report7 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1634;331;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches an element in the prohibition support across all relevant aspects (role, context, activity, resource). 

2.  **Outcome**: 
The access to perform the ""select"" activity on ""report7"" in the ""public_data"" view is granted to Chloe_Walker.

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
* **Role Preference**: 
    * The permission support states Chloe_Walker is a ""researcher"" in the organization ""Institute3"" (preferred over ""post_doc"" in ""Institute2"" for the first prohibition).
    *  The permission support also indicates Chloe_Walker's role as ""researcher"", which is preferred over the ""secondee"" role mentioned in the second prohibition.
* **Context Preference**:
   * The context ""audit"" in the permission is preferred over ""collaboration"" in both prohibitions.

* **Matching Elements**:
    * Both the permission and prohibitions share the same activity (""select""), the same organization (""Consortium""), and the same resource (""report7""). Since these elements are identical, they don't contribute to dominance.

**Conclusion**: 
Because the permission support's role and context are both strictly preferred to those in the prohibition supports, the access is granted according to the dominance rule.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2052;350;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for every support associated with a prohibition,  there exists a corresponding permission support where the permission support strictly dominates the prohibition support. Domination occurs when each element in the permission support is preferred to, or matches, at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support based on the defined preferences. 
2.  **Outcome**: The access to perform the ""drop"" activity on ""dataset5"" is granted to Liam_Taylor. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:  The decision is based on comparing the supports of permissions and prohibitions, considering the defined preferences: 
    * **Liam_Taylor's Roles**:
        * Liam_Taylor holds roles like ""coordinator"", ""team_leader"", ""full_professor"" in different organizations. These roles are preferred over the ""associate_professor"" role held by Liam_Taylor at University2, which is associated with the prohibition.
    *  **Contexts**: 
       * Contexts like ""management"", ""secondment"" are preferred over ""collaboration"" in determining access. Liam_Taylor operates within preferred contexts for the permissions, while the prohibition is linked to a less preferred context (""collaboration"").
    *   **Dataset & Activity**: 
         * The specific dataset (""dataset5"") and activity (""drop"") are consistent across both permission and prohibition supports, implying no preference conflict in this area. 

    * **Summary**:  The combination of preferred roles, contexts, and consistent dataset/activity leads to the overall dominance of the permission supports over the prohibition support, granting Liam_Taylor access.

### Output:";2287;415;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for each prohibition support, there exists at least one corresponding permission support where the permission support's dominance over the prohibition support is established. Dominance is achieved when each element in the permission support strictly prefers at least one equivalent element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access to perform the ""select"" activity on ""deliverable1"" is granted to Amelia_King. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:  The decision is based on comparing the supports of permissions and prohibitions, considering the preferences between roles, contexts, and organizations. 

    * **Permission Supports Dominate Prohibition Supports:**
        * **Permission 1 (Institute3 - Researcher):** 
            * Role: Researcher (preferred over PhD_student in Prohibition 1)
            * Context: Management (preferred over Default in both Prohibitions 1 & 2)
        *  **Permission 2 (University2 - Full Professor):**
            *  Role: Full Professor (preferred over both PhD_student and post_doc in relevant Prohibitions)
            
            *   Context: Management (Preferred over Default in relevant Prohibition)

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1843;311;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of permission support over prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: 
   Access is granted to Tina_Allen for performing the activity ""sign"" on ""dataset7"". 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    * **Role Preference**:
        *  The organization Institute1 employs Tina_Allen as a ""coordinator"", which is preferred over the role ""post_doc"" held by Tina_Allen at the University1.
        * Similarly, the role ""full_professor"" at University2, where Tina_Allen is employed, is preferred over  ""post_doc"".

    * **Context Preference**:
       * The context ""secondment"" in which Tina_Allen performs ""sign"" with ""dataset7"" at Institute1 is preferred to the ""default"" context at University1. 
       *  The context ""audit"" in which she performs the same action at University2 is preferred to ""default"" at University1 as well.

    *  **Dominance**:
        Due to the preferred roles and contexts in the permission supports, they dominate the corresponding prohibition support. This dominance satisfies the decision rule, leading to the granting of access.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1439;356;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support according to the defined preferences. 
2.  **Outcome**:  
    The access to perform the ""copy"" activity on ""report6"" within the ""administration"" view is granted to Alice_Johnson. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    * **Role Preference**: The permission support states that Alice_Johnson is employed as a ""wp_leader"" by the ""University2"", while the prohibition support indicates she is a ""post_doc"" at ""University3"". 
    ""Wp_leader"" is strictly preferred over ""Post_doc"" based on the defined preferences, thus giving the permission support an advantage. 

    * **Context Preference**:  The permission support specifies the ""audit"" context, while the prohibition mentions the ""collaboration"" context. ""Audit"" is preferred over ""collaboration"", further strengthening the permission support.

    *  **Shared Elements**: Both the permission and prohibition support share the following elements:
        * The organization ""Consortium"" considers ""copy"" as a ""modify"" activity.
        * Both utilize ""report6"".
        * Since these elements are identical, they do not contribute to the dominance comparison.

    **Conclusion**: Because the permission support's role and context elements are both strictly preferred to the prohibition support's corresponding elements, the access is granted according to the dominance rule.

        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1640;353;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches an element in the corresponding prohibition support.

2.  **Outcome**: 
The access to perform the ""validate"" activity (sign) on ""dataset4"" in the view ""WP1"" is granted.


3.  **Relations & Preferences**:

*   **Permission Support Dominance:**
    *   **Role Preference:**
        *   The organization ""Institute2"" employs Paul_Harris as a ""coordinator,"" which is preferred over the roles ""secondee"" (in the prohibition from ""Institute2"") and ""staff_member"" (in a prohibition from ""University3""). This preference is established because ""coordinator"" is considered a higher-level role compared to the other roles.
    *    **Context Preference:**
       *   The context ""secondment"" in the permission is preferred to the context ""collaboration"" in both prohibitions. This preference is based on the specific nature of the tasks and the level of control required within each context.
*   **Prohibition Support Analysis:** 
    *  We have two prohibitions:
        *  From ""Institute2"":  ""secondee"" role, ""collaboration"" context.
        * From ""University3"": ""staff member"" role,  ""collaboration"" context

    * Both prohibitions are outweighed by the permission due to the stronger role (""coordinator"") and context (""secondment"") in the permission.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";2689;381;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates it. Dominance occurs when each element in the permission support is preferred to or matches at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access to perform the ""cat"" activity on ""report6"" is granted to Ursula_Carter.

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:

    *   **Role Preferences:**
        *   Ursula_Carter's role as ""full_professor"" in the organization ""Institute2"" is preferred over her role as ""secondee"" in ""University3"", ""University2"", and ""Institute1"".

        *  Ursula_Carter as ""coordinator"" in ""Institute1"" is preferred to ""secondee"", ""associate_professor"", and ""team_leader"" roles. 

    * **Context Preferences**:
        * The ""audit"" context in ""Institute2,"" ""University2,"" and  ""Institute1""  is preferred over the ""collaboration,"" ""default,"" and ""management"" contexts.

    *  **Matching Elements**: Some elements in the permission and prohibition supports are identical (e.g., ""Ursula_Carter,"" ""cat,"" ""report6,"" and ""Consortium""). These do not require a preference comparison.



    As a result of these preferences, each prohibition is outweighed by a corresponding permission with a more preferred role, context, or both. This satisfies the decision rule, leading to the granting of access.

**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for James_Wilson to perform sign on dataset8 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2647;355;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support where the permission’s support dominantes the prohibition’s support.  Dominance occurs when each element in the permission support is strictly preferable to *at least one* element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access to perform the ""sign"" activity on ""dataset8"" is granted to James_Wilson. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:  The decision is based on comparing the supports of various permissions and prohibitions. Here's a breakdown:

    * **James_Wilson's Roles:** James_Wilson holds the roles of ""researcher"" and ""coordinator"" in different organizations (University3, Institute3). These roles are preferred to the ""secondee"" role held by him in Institute2 and Institute1. 
    * **Contexts:**  The contexts ""audit,"" ""secondment,"" and ""management"" are preferred over the ""default"" context. 

    Let's analyze how these factors relate to the prohibitions:

     * **Prohibition 1 (Institute2 - Secondee - Default):** This prohibition is overridden because:
         * James_Wilson is a ""researcher/coordinator"" (preferred over ""secondee"").
         * The ""audit/secondment/management"" contexts are preferred over ""default.""

     *  **Prohibition 2 & 3 (Institute2 & Institute1 - Secondee & Default):** Similar to Prohibition 1, these are also overridden due to the preferred roles and contexts. 



    Therefore, all prohibitions are outweighed by the corresponding permissions, leading to the granting of access.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Input:1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if,         for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.         Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization University3 grants the role full_professor the Permission to perform the activity validate on the view reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation University3 employes Ben_Foster in the role full_professor, The organisation Consortium considers sign as a validate activity, The organisation University3 uses report3 in the view reports, The context secondment holds between Ben_Foster, sign, and report3 in the organisation University3,  
3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
(support 1): The organization University3 grants the role post_doc the Prohibition to perform the activity validate on the view administration if the context collaboration holds,The organisation University3 employes Ben_Foster in the role post_doc, The organisation Consortium considers sign as a validate activity, The organisation University3 uses report3 in the view administration, The context collaboration holds between Ben_Foster, sign, and report3 in the organisation University3,  
4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation University3 employes Ben_Foster in the role full_professor, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University3 employes Ben_Foster in the role post_doc, `` because: full_professor is preferred to post_doc. 
The relation ``The context secondment holds between Ben_Foster, sign, and report3 in the organisation University3, `` is preferred to ``The context collaboration holds between Ben_Foster, sign, and report3 in the organisation University3, `` because: secondment is preferred to collaboration. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Ben_Foster to perform sign on report3 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1443;344;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support according to the defined preferences. 
2.  **Outcome**: 
   The access is GRANTED. Ben_Foster is permitted to perform the ""sign"" activity on ""report3"" within the ""reports"" view. 
3.  **Relations and Prefrences**: 
     * **Role Preference**: The permission support states that Ben_Foster holds the role ""full_professor"" in the organization University3. This is preferred to the prohibition support, which assigns Ben_Foster the role ""post_doc"" in the same organization.  
     *  **Context Preference**:  The permission support indicates the context ""secondment"" applies to Ben_Foster's actions, while the prohibition support uses the context ""collaboration"". ""Secondment"" is preferred over ""collaboration"" in this scenario. 
    * **Matching Elements**: Both the permission and prohibition support share the following elements:
        * The organization Consortium considers ""sign"" as a ""validate"" activity.
        *  The organization University3 uses ""report3"", which is the target report for both the permission and the prohibition. 

    Since the permission support's role and context are both preferred to those in the prohibition, and the shared elements are identical, the dominance condition is satisfied, leading to the granting of access.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1447;341;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support according to the defined preferences. 
2.  **Outcome**:  
    The access to perform the ""sign"" activity on the ""report1"" view is granted to Bob_Smith. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    * **Role Preference**: The permission support states that Bob_Smith is employed as a ""team_leader"" by the ""University1"", while the prohibition support indicates Bob_Smith as a ""secondee"" employed by ""Institute3"". 
    The role ""team leader"" is preferred over the role ""secondee"". This preference satisfies the dominance condition for the role element. 
    *  **Context Preference**:  The permission support specifies the ""secondment"" context, while the prohibition uses the ""collaboration"" context.  
    ""Secondment"" is preferred to ""collaboration"". This preference also satisfies the dominance requirement for the context element. 

    * **Activity & View Consistency**: Both the permission and prohibition support agree on the activity (""sign"") and the view (""report1""). No preference comparison is needed for these elements as they are identical in both supports.


    Since both role and context preferences favor the permission support, the overall dominance condition is met, granting Bob_Smith access to perform ""sign"" on ""report1"".

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2260;481;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates it. Dominance is achieved when each element in the permission support is preferred to, or matches, at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access to perform the ""insert"" activity on ""report6"" is granted to Liam_Taylor. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**: The decision is based on comparing the supports of various permissions and prohibitions. Here's a breakdown:

    * **Permissions:**
        * **Permission 1:** Granted by Institute3, Liam_Taylor as researcher, ""secondment"" context, ""insert"" as modify activity, report6 in view WP5. 
            * This permission is preferred over the prohibitions because:
                * Liam_Taylor's role as researcher is preferred over staff_member (Institute2 prohibition).
                * ""Secondment"" context is preferred over ""collaboration"" (Institute2).

        * **Permissions 2 & 3:**  Granted by Institute1, with Liam_Taylor holding roles ""coordinator"" and ""wp_leader"" respectively. Both operate under the ""audit"" context and involve ""insert"" on report6 in views ""data"" and ""WP4"".
            * These permissions are preferred over prohibitions because: 
                * Both roles (coordinator and wp_leader) are preferred over ""staff_member"" and ""associate_professor"" in the respective prohibitions.
                *  ""Audit"" context trumps ""collaboration"" and ""default"" contexts in the prohibitions.

     * **Prohibitions:**
         * **Prohibition 1:** Institute2 grants Liam_Taylor (as staff_member) the prohibition to modify report6 in ""reports"" view under the ""collaboration"" context. 
         *  **Prohibition 2:** University2 grants Liam Taylor (as associate_professor) the prohibition against modifying report6 in  ""WP3"" view under ""default"" context.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation Institute3 employes Chloe_Walker in the role full_professor, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University1 employes Chloe_Walker in the role PhD_student, `` because: full_professor is preferred to PhD_student. 
The relation ``The context management holds between Chloe_Walker, edit, and report2 in the organisation Institute3, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Chloe_Walker, edit, and report2 in the organisation University1, `` because: management is preferred to default.

**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Chloe_Walker to perform edit on report2 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1837;325;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of permission supports over prohibition supports. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: 
     Access is granted to Chloe_Walker for the activity ""modify"" on the view ""report2"".

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    * **Role Preference:**
        *  Chloe_Walker is employed as a ""full_professor"" by Institute3, which is preferred to the ""PhD_student"" role she holds at University1.
        * Chloe_Walker is also a ""coordinator"" at Institute1 and a ""researcher"" at Institute3, both roles preferred to ""PhD student"".

    * **Context Preference**:
        * The ""management"" context in which Chloe_Walker operates at Institute3 and Institute1 is preferred over the ""default"" context at University1 where she is a PhD student.
        
        * Similarly, the ""secondment"" context at Institute3 is preferred to ""default"" in the case of Chloe_Walker's researcher role.


    * **Dominance:**
        Since the permission supports (full_professor, coordinator, researcher) are all preferred to the prohibition support (PhD_student), and the contexts (management, secondment) are preferred to the default context, the permission supports dominate the prohibition supports. This satisfies the decision rule, granting Chloe_Walker access to modify report2.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";3635;373;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support where the permission support strictly dominates the prohibition support. Domination means each element in the permission support is preferred over at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support based on the defined preferences. 
2.  **Outcome**: Access to perform the ""create"" activity on ""dataset1"" is granted to Eva_Clark. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**: The decision is based on the comparison of supports for permissions and prohibitions, taking into account the defined preferences between roles, contexts, and other elements. 
    * **Role Preferences**: Roles like ""coordinator"", ""wp_leader"", and ""researcher"" are generally preferred over roles like ""post_doc"", ""associate_professor"", and ""staff_member"". This preference is reflected in the decision as permissions granted to higher-preferred roles are more likely to be granted.
    *  **Context Preferences**: Contexts like ""audit"", ""management"", and ""secondment"" are preferred over contexts like ""default"", ""collaboration"", and ""general"". This preference leads to permissions granted under preferred contexts having a higher chance of being approved. 
   * **Specific Examples**: 
       *  Eva_Clark's role as ""coordinator"" in the ""Institute3"" under the ""audit"" context is preferred over her potential roles in other organizations under less preferred contexts (e.g., ""University3"" under ""default"" or ""University1"" under ""collaboration"").
       * Similarly, the ""management"" context is favored over ""collaboration"" and ""default"" contexts, leading to permissions granted in ""management"" contexts being more likely approved.

        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1867;355;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support according to the defined preferences. 
2.  **Outcome**: 
     The access to perform the ""sign"" activity on the ""report7"" in the ""secondment_agreement"" view is granted to Isla_Martin. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
     * **Role Preference**: 
         * The permission support states that Isla_Martin holds the role ""full_professor"" in the organization ""University1"". This role is strictly preferred over the roles ""post_doc"" (in University2 and Institute3) and ""staff_member"" (University3) mentioned in the prohibition supports. 
     *  **Context Preference**:
         *  The permission support specifies the context ""secondment"" for the activity ""sign"" on ""report7"". This context is preferred over the contexts ""default"" (University2, University3), and ""collaboration"" (Institute3). 


     * **Matching Elements**:
         The remaining elements in both the permission and prohibition supports (activity ""sign"", object ""report7"", and the organization ""Consortium"") are identical. Therefore, they do not contribute to the dominance comparison. 

     * **Conclusion**:
         Since the permission support's role and context are strictly preferred over those in the prohibitions, the permission support dominates all prohibition supports. This satisfies the decision rule, leading to the granting of access.

### Output:";2280;380;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of permission supports over prohibition supports. 
    A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: 
     Access is granted. Dylan_Nelson is permitted to perform the ""move"" activity on ""dataset3"".

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    * **Role Preferences:**
        *  The organization Institute3 employs Dylan_Nelson as a ""researcher"", which is preferred to the ""PhD_student"" role held by Dylan_Nelson at Institute1 and the ""post_doc"" role at University1.
        * Dylan_Nelson's role as a ""team_leader"" at University2 is preferred to both ""PhD_students"" and ""post_docs"". 
        * Similarly, Dylan_Nelson being a ""full_professor"" at  University2 is preferred over ""PhD_Students"" and ""Post_docs"".

    * **Context Preferences:**
       * The ""audit"" context at Institute3 is preferred over the ""collaboration"" context at both Institute1 and University1. 
       * ""Management"" context at University2 takes precedence over ""collaboration"" contexts at both universities.
       *  The ""secondment"" context in University2 is also preferred to ""collaboration"" in both universities.


    * **Dominance:** 
    The combination of preferred roles and contexts in the permission supports (Institute3 researcher, audit context) outweighs the prohibition supports (Institute1/University1 roles, collaboration contexts). This dominance satisfies the decision rule, granting Dylan_Nelson access.

**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Ben_Foster to perform sign on deliverable1 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2289;526;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for each prohibition support, there exists at least one corresponding permission support where the permission support's dominance over the prohibition support is established. Dominance is achieved when each element in the permission support strictly prefers at least one equivalent element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access to perform the ""sign"" activity on ""deliverable1"" within the ""WP4"" view is granted to Ben_Foster. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:  The decision is based on the following relationships and preferences:

    * **University1 vs. Institute2 Employment**:  Ben_Foster's employment by University1 in roles like ""full_professor"" and ""coordinator"" is preferred over his hypothetical employment by Institute2 in roles such as ""staff_member"" or ""PhD_student."" This preference stems from the hierarchical nature of academic roles, with professors generally holding higher authority than staff or students.
    * **Secondment vs. Collaboration Context**: The ""secondment"" context is preferred over the ""collaboration"" context. This implies that activities performed under a secondment arrangement have a higher level of authorization compared to those conducted within a collaborative setting. 
    *  **Audit vs. Collaboration/Secondment Context**:  The ""audit"" context is also preferred over both ""collaboration"" and ""secondment."" This suggests that activities performed during an audit are subject to stricter scrutiny and require higher levels of authorization.

    **Analyzing the Prohibitions**:

    *  The prohibition against Ben_Foster performing ""validate"" in ""administration"" under ""collaboration"" at Institute2 is irrelevant because it doesn't involve the same view (""WP4""), activity (""sign""), or context (""secondment"") as the granted permission.

    * The prohibition against ""validate"" by Ben_Foster as a ""PhD student"" in ""WP3"" under ""Collaboration"" is also irrelevant due to the differing view, activity, and context. 

    * Finally, the University1 prohibition for ""secondee"" role in ""WP4,"" under ""collaboration,"" is outweighed by the University1 permission for ""full professor"" in the same view, under ""secondment,"" due to the higher role preference and preferred context.



Therefore, all conditions for granting access are met, leading to the final decision to grant Ben_Foster permission to perform ""sign"" on ""Deliverable1"" in ""view WP4.""

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1646;423;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support.  A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches an element in the prohibition support across all relevant aspects (role, context, activity, resource).

2.  **Outcome**: 
The access is GRANTED. Mia_Anderson is permitted to perform the ""sign"" activity on ""dataset8"" within the ""reports"" view due to the dominance of her permission support over both prohibition supports.

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:

*   **Permission Support Dominance:**
    *   **Role Preference:** The permission involves Mia_Anderson as a ""coordinator"" in University1, which is preferred over the ""staff_member"" role in Institute2 and the ""PhD_student"" role in University3. This preference is based on the organizational hierarchy and responsibilities associated with each role.
    *    **Context Preference:**  The permission operates within the ""secondment"" context in University1. This context is preferred over both the ""collaboration"" context in both Institute2 and University3. ""Secondment"" implies a more specific and controlled environment for data access and validation compared to the broader ""collaboration"" contexts.
*   **Prohibition Support Analysis:** Both prohibition supports are weaker than the permission support due to the role and context preferences outlined above. 
    *  **Prohibition 1 (Institute2):**  While this prohibition also involves ""Mia_Anderson"" and ""dataset8,"" it operates under a less preferred role (""staff_member"") and a less preferred context (""collaboration"").
    * **Prohibition 2 (University3):**  Similar to Prohibition 1, this prohibition suffers from the less preferred role and context compared to the permission.



Therefore, the permission support dominates both prohibition supports, leading to the granting of access to Mia_Anderson.

        *  The ""researcher"" role in Institute2 is preferred over the ""postdoc"" and ""secondee"" roles in the same organization due to its focus on independent research and analysis.
    *  **Context Preferences**:
       *   The ""secondment"" context in Institute1 takes precedence over the ""collaboration"", ""management"", and ""default"" contexts in other organizations because it signifies a formal agreement for knowledge sharing and collaborative work. 
       *  ""Management"" context is preferred over ""collaboration"" and ""default"".

        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation Institute1 employes Bob_Smith in the role researcher, `` is preferred to ``The organisation Institute2 employes Bob_Smith in the role post_doc, `` because: researcher is preferred to post_doc. 
The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob_Smith, sign, and agreement3 in the organisation Institute1, `` is preferred to ``The context collaboration holds between Bob_Smith, sign, and agreement3 in the organisation Institute2, `` because: secondment is preferred to collaboration.

**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob_Smith to perform sign on agreement3 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1953;411;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches an element in the corresponding prohibition support.

2.  **Outcome**: 
   Access is granted to Bob_Smith for performing the activity ""sign"" on the view ""agreement3"".

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    * **Permission Supports:**
        * **Institute1 Researcher:** Bob_Smith is employed as a researcher at Institute1, which is preferred over being a post-doc or secondee at Institute2. This preference is based on the role hierarchy (researcher > post-doc, researcher > secondee).
        *  **Secondment Context:** The context ""secondment"" holds between Bob-Smith, ""sign"" (the activity), and ""agreement3"" (the view) at Institute1. This context is preferred over ""collaboration"" or ""default"" contexts.

    * **Prohibition Supports:**
       * **Institute2 Post-Doc:**  Bob_Smith's role at Institute2 is as a postdoc, which is less preferred than researcher.
       *  **Collaboration Context:**  The context ""collaboration"" holds at Institute2, but it's less preferred than ""secondment"".
       *   **Default Context:** The ""default"" context at Institute2 has the lowest preference.

    **Dominance Analysis:**
    *  The permission support at Institute1 dominates the prohibition supports at Institute2 because:
        * The ""researcher"" role at Institute1 is preferred over the ""post-doc"" role.
        * ""Secondment"" context is preferred to both ""collaboration"" and ""default"".
    * This dominance satisfies the decision rule, leading to the granting of access.

 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";3172;383;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support where the permission support dominates the prohibitions support. Domination means each element in the permission support is preferred to at lease one element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access to perform the ""sign"" activity on ""dataset3"" is granted.  

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:  The decision is based on the comparison of supports for permissions and prohibitions, considering the preferences defined in the input. Here's a breakdown:

    *   **Role Preferences:**
        *   Roles like ""wp_leader,"" ""full_professor,"" and ""team_leader"" are generally preferred over roles like ""PhD_student,"" ""associate_professor,"" or ""staff_member."" This preference is reflected in the comparison of permission and prohibition supports involving Isla_Martin's role assignments.

    * **Context Preferences:** 

        *   Contexts like ""secondment"" and ""audit"" are preferred over contexts like ""collaboration,"" ""default,"" or ""no context."" This preference influences the comparison of contexts used in permission and prohibition statements.

        * For example, the permission to ""sign"" dataset3 under the ""secondment context"" is preferred over the prohibition to ""validate"" under the ""collaboration context.""

    *  **Element Matching:** Some elements in both permission and prohibition support are identical (e.g., ""Isla_Martin,"" ""sign,"" ""dataset3,"" and ""Consortium""). These elements do not contribute to the dominance comparison as they are not preferred over each other.


    The combination of these role, context, and element preferences leads to the conclusion that the permission to perform ""sign"" on dataset3 under specific contexts outweighs any prohibitions based on different roles, contexts, or activities.

4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Wendy_Mitchell to perform sign on report2 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1420;357;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted based on the principle of dominance. If a prohibition exists, the corresponding permission must dominate the prohibition. Dominance occurs when each element in the permission support is preferred to, or matches, at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: 
The access is GRANTED. Wendy_Mitchell is permitted to perform the ""sign"" activity on ""report2"" based on the permissions granted by University1, Institute1, and Institute3. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:  
There are no explicitly defined prohibitions in the provided input. Therefore, the decision is solely based on the granted permissions. 

* **University1 Permission (Support 1):** 
    * Role: researcher
    * User: Wendy_Mitchell
    * Activity: validate
    * View: WP5
    * Context: management
* **Institute1 Permission(Support 2):**
   * Role: full_professor
   * User:Wendy_Mitchell
   * Activity:validate
   * View:secondment_report
   * Context: audit
* **Instance3 Permission (Support3):**
    *Role: researcher
   *User: Wendy_ Mitchell
   *Activity: validate
   *View: WP4
   *Context: management



Since there are no prohibitions to compare against, the granted permissions establish Wendy_Mitchell's access to perform ""validate"" on the specified views and contexts. 

**Important Note:** This explanation assumes there are no hidden or unstated prohibitions in the system. If prohibitions exist but are not explicitly listed in the input, the decision may be different.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1424;492;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted only if for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support where the permission’s support strictly dominates the prohibition’s support.  Dominance means each element in the permission support is preferred to *at least one* element in the prohibition support.

2.  **Outcome**: 
The access is denied. Olivia_Scott is not granted permission to perform ""sign"" on ""report5"".

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:

* **Prohibition 1 (Institute1):**
    * Role: staff_member
    * Organization: Institute1
    * Activity: validate
    * View: WP4
    * Context: collaboration
    * **No Dominant Permission Found:** There isn't a corresponding permission with a support that strictly dominates this prohibition.

*  **Prohibition 2 (University1):** 
    *  Role: secondee
    *   Organization: University1
     *  Activity: validate
     *   View: public_data
     *    Context: collaboration 
     * **Domination Not Achieved:** While there might be permissions for ""sign"" elsewhere, they don't strictly dominate this prohibition. For example, if a permission existed for ""validate"" on ""WP4"" in the ""collaboration"" context, it wouldn't necessarily dominate this prohibition because the role (""secondee"") and organization (""University1"") are different.

* ** Prohibitions 3 (Institute3):**
   * Role : staff_member 
   * Organization : Institute3
   * Activity : validate
   * View : WP1
   * Context : collaboration
   *  **No Dominant Permission:** Similar to Prohibition 1, there's no clear permission that dominates this prohibition based on the provided information.



**Key Points:**

* **Strict Dominance:** The decision rule requires *strict* dominance. A permission support simply matching a prohibition support isn't enough.
* **Context Matters:** The context (""collaboration"") is a crucial factor in determining whether a permission dominates a prohibition. 
* **Role and Organization:** The specific role and organization associated with a permission or prohibition are also important for comparison.

### Output:";1992;521;"1.  **Decision Rule**:
    Access is granted based on the dominance of permission support over prohibition support. For each prohibition, there must exist a corresponding permission with a support that strictly dominates it. Dominance is achieved when each element in the permission support is preferred over at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support.

2.  **Outcome**:
    The access to perform the ""list"" activity on ""deliverable1"" is granted. This decision is reached because the permission supports dominate the prohibition supports based on the defined preferences.

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    *   **Permission Supports:**
        *   **University3 Permission:**
            *   Role Assignment: Nathan_White is employed as a ""full_professor"" by University3. This is preferred over the prohibitions involving ""associate_professor"" or ""staff_member"" roles.
            *    Context: The ""audit"" context holds for this permission. This context is preferred over ""collaboration"" or ""default"" contexts present in the prohibitions.
        *    **Institute2 Permission (WP5):**
            *     Role Assignment:  Nathan_White holds the ""wp_leader"" role at Institute2. This role is preferred over both ""associate professor"" and ""staff member"".
            *      Context: The  ""secondment"" context applies to this permission, which is preferred over  ""collaboration"" or  ""default"" contexts.

    *  **Prohibition Supports:**
       *   **Institute2 Prohibition (internal_data):**
           *   Role assignment: Nathan White is an ""associate professor"", which is less preferred than the ""full professor"" or ""wp leader"" roles in the permissions.
           *    Context : The ""collaboration"" context is used here, which is not as preferred as ""audit"" or ""secondment"" contexts.
       *  **Institute3 Prohibition (contracts):**
          *    Role assignment:  Nathan White is a ""staff member"", which is the least preferred role compared to the other roles involved in permissions.
          *     Context:  The ""default"" context applies, which is the lowest preference compared to ""audit"", ""secondment"", or ""collaboration"".

    * **Dominance:** The permission supports consistently demonstrate higher preferences in both role assignments and contexts compared to the prohibition supports. This dominance satisfies the decision rule, leading to the granting of access.

(support 1): The organization University1 grants the role secondee the Prohibition to perform the activity consult on the view WP1 if the context collaboration holds,The organisation University1 employes Zane_Gonzalez in the role secondee, The organisation Consortium considers ask as a consult activity, The organisation University1 uses agreement6 in the view WP1, The context collaboration holds between Zane_Gonzalez, ask, and agreement6 in the organisation University1,  
4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation Institute1 employes Zane_Gonzalez in the role team_leader, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University1 employes Zane_Gonzalez in the role secondee, `` because: team_leader is preferred to secondee. 
The relation ``The context management holds between Zane_Gonzalez, ask, and agreement6 in the organisation Institute1, `` is preferred to ``The context collaboration holds between Zane_Gonzalez, ask, and agreement6 in the organisation University1, `` because: management is preferred to collaboration. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Zane_Gonzalez to perform ask on agreement6 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1441;347;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support according to the defined preferences. 
2.  **Outcome**:  
    The access to perform the ""ask"" activity on ""agreement6"" in the ""internal_data"" view is granted to Zane_Gonzalez. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    * **Role Preference**: The permission support specifies Zane_Gonzalez as a ""team_leader"" within the ""Institute1"" organization, while the prohibition support designates him as a ""secondee"" within ""University1"". 
        * ""Team_leader"" is strictly preferred over ""secondee"". This preference directly favors the permission over the prohibition. 
    *  **Context Preference**:  The permission context is ""management"", while the prohibition context is ""collaboration"".
        *  ""Management"" is strictly preferable to ""collaboration"". This preference further reinforces the dominance of permission over prohibition. 

    * **Shared Elements**: Both the permission and prohibition support share the following elements:
        * The organization ""Consortium"" considers ""ask"" as a ""consult"" activity.
        * Both utilize ""agreement6"".
        
        These shared elements do not introduce any preference conflicts, as they are identical in both supports.


    Since both role and context preferences favor the permission support, the access is granted according to the decision rule.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
(support 1): The organization University3 grants the role post_doc the Prohibition to perform the activity consult on the view data if the context collaboration holds,The organisation University3 employes Victor_Turner in the role post_doc, The organisation Consortium considers describe as a consult activity, The organisation University3 uses report5 in the view data, The context collaboration holds between Victor_Turner, describe, and report5 in the organisation University3,  
(support 2): The organization University1 grants the role PhD_student the Prohibition to perform the activity consult on the view public_data if the context collaboration holds,The organisation University1 employes Victor_Turner in the role PhD_student, The organisation Consortium considers describe as a consult activity, The organisation University1 uses report5 in the view public_data, The context collaboration holds between Victor_Turner, describe, and report5 in the organisation University1,  
(support 3): The organization Institute2 grants the role associate_professor the Prohibition to perform the activity consult on the view public_data if the context collaboration holds,The organisation Institute2 employes Victor_Turner in the role associate_professor, The organisation Consortium considers describe as a consult activity, The organisation Institute2 uses report5 in the view public_data, The context collaboration holds between Victor_Turner, describe, and report5 in the organisation Institute2,  
4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Victor_Turner to perform describe on report5 is denied. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1426;366;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted only if for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates it. Dominance occurs when each element in the permission support strictly prefers at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support.

2.  **Outcome**: 
The access is denied. Victor_Turner's permission to perform ""describe"" on ""report5"" is denied because no corresponding permission support dominates any of the prohibition supports.

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:

* **Prohibition 1 (University3):**
    * Role: post_doc
    * Employee: Victor_Turner
    * Activity: consult
    * View: data
    * Context: collaboration
* **Prohibitions 2 & 3 (University1 & Institute2):** 
    * These prohibitions share the same structure as Prohibition 1 but differ in the granting organization (University1 and Institute2, respectively).

* **Missing Permission Support:** There is no provided permission support that directly corresponds to any of the prohibitions. To grant access, a permission support would need to exist that:
    * Assigns Victor_Turner a role with higher preference than ""post_doc,"" ""PhD_student,"" or ""associate_professor.""
    * Specifies a context that is strictly preferred over ""collaboration.""

* **No Preference Information:** The input lacks information about preferences between organizations (University3 vs. University1 vs. Institute2) or roles (post_doc vs. PhD_student vs. associate_professor). Without this information, it's impossible to determine if a permission support could dominate a prohibition support.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1844;318;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches an element in the prohibition support across all relevant aspects (role, context, activity, resource). 

2.  **Outcome**: 
The access to perform the ""cat"" activity on ""deliverable2"" is granted to Wendy_Mitchell. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
   * **Role Preference**:
      * The permission support involves Wendy_Mitchell as a ""researcher"" in the organization University1, which is preferred over the roles of ""PhD_student"" (Institute3), ""staff_member"" (University3), and ""post_doc"" (university3) present in the prohibition supports. 
   *  **Context Preference**: 
      *  The permission context is ""audit"" in University1, preferred over the ""collaboration"" context in Institute3 and University3, and the ""default"" context in University3. 

   * **Activity & Resource Consistency**: 
       *  All supports agree on ""cat"" as the activity and ""deliverables2"" as the resource. No preference comparison is needed here as they are consistent across all supports. 



   Therefore, the permission support dominates all prohibition supports due to the preferred role, preferred context, and consistent activity/resource elements. This satisfies the decision rule, leading to the granting of access.

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
   * **Quinn_Thomas' Roles**: 
      * Quinn_Thomas is employed as a ""team_leader"" by University1 and as a ""coordinator"" by Institute1. These roles are both preferred to the ""post_doc"" role held by Quinn_Thomas at University3.
   *  **Contexts**:
      * The ""audit"" context in both University1 and Institute1 is preferred over the ""collaboration"" context in University3.

   * **Dominance Analysis**:
      Let's analyze how the permission and prohibition supports compare:

      * **Permission Support (University1 & Institute1):**
         * Role: team leader/coordinator (preferred over post_doc)
         * Context: audit (preferred over collaboration)
         
      * **Prohibition Support (University3):**
          * Role: post_doc
          * Context: collaboration

      Since the permission supports have preferred roles and contexts compared to the prohibition support, they dominate the prohibition support according to the decision rule. 


Therefore, Quinn_Thomas's access to perform ""drop"" is granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

An access is granted if and only if,         for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.         Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization University2 grants the role team_leader the Permission to perform the activity consult on the view WP1 if the context management holds,The organisation University2 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role team_leader, The organisation Consortium considers select as a consult activity, The organisation University2 uses dataset2 in the view WP1, The context management holds between Wendy_Mitchell, select, and dataset2 in the organisation University2,  
3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
(support 1): The organization University1 grants the role post_doc the Prohibition to perform the activity consult on the view WP1 if the context collaboration holds,The organisation University1 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role post_doc, The organisation Consortium considers select as a consult activity, The organisation University1 uses dataset2 in the view WP1, The context collaboration holds between Wendy_Mitchell, select, and dataset2 in the organisation University1,  
4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation University2 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role team_leader, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University1 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role post_doc, `` because: team_leader is preferred to post_doc. 
The relation ``The context management holds between Wendy_Mitchell, select, and dataset2 in the organisation University2, `` is preferred to ``The context collaboration holds between Wendy_Mitchell, select, and dataset2 in the organisation University1, `` because: management is preferred to collaboration. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Wendy_Mitchell to perform select on dataset2 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1443;364;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when, for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates it. Dominance occurs when each element in the permission support is more preferred than at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support.

2.  **Outcome**: 
The access to perform the ""select"" activity on ""dataset2"" within the ""WP1"" view is granted to Wendy_Mitchell.

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:

*   **Role Preference**: The permission support states that Wendy_Mitchell is employed as a ""team_leader"" by ""University2"", while the prohibition support states she is a ""post_doc"" at ""University1"".  ""team_leader > post_doc"" based on the defined preferences. This means Wendy_Mitchell's role in the permission scenario is more preferred.
*   **Context Preference**: The context for the permission is ""management"", while the context for the prohibition is ""collaboration"". ""management > collaboration"" according to the preferences. This signifies a stronger context for the permitted action.

* **Other Elements**: Both the permission and prohibition support share:
    *   The organization ""Consortium"" considers ""select"" as a ""consult"" activity.
    *    The organization ""University2"" (for permission) and ""University1"" (for prohibition) both use ""dataset2"". 
    Since these elements are identical, they don't contribute to the dominance comparison.

Because the permission support's role (""team_leader"") and context (""management"") are both more preferred than the prohibition support's (""post_doc"", ""collaboration""), the permission dominates the prohibition. This satisfies the decision rule, leading to the granting of access.

### Output:";1414;445;"**1. Decision Rule:**
Access is granted based on the dominance of permission support over prohibition support.  A permission is considered dominant if each element in its support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support.

**2. Outcome:** 
The access to perform ""describe"" on ""agreement6"" is granted to Olivia_Scott.

**3. Relations and Preferences:**

* **Missing Prohibition Support:** There is no defined prohibition support provided in the input. Without a prohibition to compare against, the decision rule cannot be fully applied. 

* **Permission Supports:**
    * **Support 1 (Institute3):** Grants Olivia_Scott (as researcher) permission to ""consult"" on ""WP4"" under the ""management"" context.
    *  **Support 2 (Institute1):** Grants  Olivia_Scott  (as wp_leader) permission to  ""consult"" on  ""deliverables"" under the  ""management""  context. 
    *   **Support 3 (University3):**  Grants Olivia_Scott   (as researcher)  permission to ""consult "" on  ""reports"" under the   ""secondment"" context.

* **Assumptions:** To illustrate the decision process, we'll assume a hypothetical prohibition exists. For example, let's say there's a prohibition from Institute2 preventing Olivia_Scott from ""describing"" anything related to ""agreement6"".

* **Dominance Analysis (Hypothetical):**
    * If the prohibition support included ""Institute2"" as the granting organization, ""Olivia_Scott"" as the role, and ""describe"" as the activity, then the permission support from Institute3 (Support 1) would be dominant. This is because:
        * ""Institute3"" is preferred to ""Institute2"".
        * The context ""management"" is also preferred to any potential context in the prohibition.

**Important Note:** Without a defined prohibition support, we can only speculate on the decision outcome.

        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

An access is granted if and only if,         for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.         Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization Institute3 grants the role team_leader the Permission to perform the activity consult on the view WP2 if the context secondment holds,The organisation Institute3 employes David_Williams in the role team_leader, The organisation Consortium considers ask as a consult activity, The organisation Institute3 uses agreement1 in the view WP2, The context secondment holds between David_Williams, ask, and agreement1 in the organisation Institute3,

4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation Institute3 employes David_Williams in the role team_leader, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University2 employes David_Williams in the role post_doc, `` because: team_leader is preferred to post_doc. 
The relation ``The context secondment holds between David_Williams, ask, and agreement1 in the organisation Institute3, `` is preferred to ``The context collaboration holds between David_Williams, ask, and agreement1 in the organisation University2, `` because: secondment is preferred to collaboration. 
The relation ``The organisation Institute3 employes David_Williams in the role team_leader, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University3 employes David_Williams in the role PhD_student, `` because: team_leader is preferred to PhD_student. 
The relation ``The context secondment holds between David_Williams, ask, and agreement1 in the organisation Institute3, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between David_Williams, ask, and agreement1 in the organisation University3, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
The relation ``The organisation Institute3 employes David_Williams in the role team_leader, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University2 employes David_Williams in the role secondee, `` because: team_leader is preferred to secondee. 
The relation ``The context secondment holds between David_Williams, ask, and agreement1 in the organisation Institute3, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between David_Williams, ask, and agreement1 in the organisation University2, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for David_Williams to perform ask on agreement1 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1861;496;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support.  
    A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support according to the defined preferences. 
2.  **Outcome**:  
    The access to perform the ""ask"" activity on ""agreement1"" is granted to David_Williams. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    * **Permission Support**:
        * **Role Assignment**: David_Williams is employed in the role ""team_leader"" by the organization ""Institute3"". This role is preferred over the roles in the prohibition supports (""post_doc"", ""PhD_student"", ""secondee"").
        *  **Context**: The context ""secondment"" holds between David Williams, ""ask"" (activity), and ""agreement1"". This context is preferred over ""collaboration"", ""default"", and ""default"".
    *  **Prohibition Supports**:
        There are three prohibition supports:
            * **University2 (post_doc, collaboration, agreement1)**:  David_Williams is a ""post_doc"" at ""University2"", and the context is ""collaboration"". This is less preferred compared to the permission support's role and context. 
            *  **University3 (PhD_student, default, agreement1):** David_Williams holds the role ""PhD student"" at  ""University3"" with the context ""default"". This is also less preferred than the permission support.
            *   **University2 (secondee, default,  agreement1)**: David_Williams has the role ""secondee"" at ""university2"" with the ""default"" context. Again, this is less preferred.

    * **Dominance**: The permission support dominates all the prohibition supports because:
        * The role ""team leader"" is preferred to all other roles in the prohibitions.
        * ""Secondment"" context is preferred to ""collaboration,"" ""default,"" and ""default.""
        * All other elements (activity ""ask"" and object ""agreement1"") are identical in both the permission and prohibition supports.



Therefore, based on the defined logic and preferences, David_Williams's access to perform ""ask"" on  ""agreement1""  is granted.

        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share:

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";3145;435;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support where the permission support dominates the prohibitions support. Domination means each element in the permission support is preferred to at lease one element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access to perform the ""sign"" activity on ""dataset10"" is granted to Katherine_Moore. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:  The decision is based on comparing the supports of permissions and prohibitions, considering the preferences between roles, contexts, and other elements.  Here's a breakdown:

    * **Katherine_Moore's Roles**: Katherine_Moore is associated with several roles across different organizations: researcher (University2), full_professor (University1), coordinator (University3), and PhD_student (University3). 
    * **Preferred Roles**: The roles researcher, full professor, and coordinator are all preferred to the role of PhD_student and staff_member according to the defined preferences. This means permissions granted through these roles are more likely to be granted than those associated with PhD_student or staff_member roles.
    *  **Preferred Contexts**: The context ""secondment"" (University2) and ""management"" (University1) are preferred to contexts like ""collaboration"" (University3 and Institute3) and ""default"" (Institute3).  This means permissions granted under preferred contexts are more influential in the decision. 

   * **Domination Analysis**: 
       * Each prohibition against Katherine_Moore performing ""sign"" on various datasets and views is outweighed by a corresponding permission granted under a more preferred role, context, or both. For example, the prohibition against ""sign"" in the ""administration"" view under the ""default"" context (Institute3) is overridden by the permission granted under the ""researcher"" role and the ""management"" context (University2). 



   * **Conclusion**: The combination of preferred roles, preferred contexts, and the dominance principle leads to the overall decision to grant Katherine_Moore access to perform ""sign"".

Domination means each element in the permission support must be strictly preferred to *at least one* element in the corresponding prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: 
The access is GRANTED. Wendy_Mitchell is permitted to perform the ""add"" activity on ""dataset6"". 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:  
While there are multiple permissions granted to Wendy_Mitchell across different organizations (Institute1, University2, University3), the key factor in granting access is the dominance of the permission support over any potential prohibition support.  

* **No Explicit Prohibition:** There is no defined prohibition support provided in the input. This means that, in the absence of a specific prohibition, the granted permissions stand. 

* **Implicit Dominance:** Even if a hypothetical prohibition existed, the permission granted by Institute1 would likely dominate it. This is because:
    * **Role Preference:** ""Researcher"" (Wendy_Mitchell's role in Institute1) is generally considered a higher-level role than any implied role in a potential prohibition. 
    *  **Context Preference:** ""Secondment"" (the context for the Institute1 permission) is likely more specific and controlled than a general ""default"" context that might be implied in a prohibition.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation Institute2 employes Chloe_Walker in the role team_leader, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University3 employes Chloe_Walker in the role secondee, `` because: team_leader is preferred to secondee. 
The relation ``The context management holds between Chloe_Walker, edit, and report3 in the organisation Institute2, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Chloe_Walker, edit, and report3 in the organisation University3, `` because: management is preferred to default.

### Output:";1642;335;"1.  **Decision Rule**:
    Access is granted based on the dominance of permission support over prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support.

2.  **Outcome**:
    The access to modify report3 in view WP2 is granted to Chloe_Walker.

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:

    *   **Role Preference**:
        *   The permission support states Chloe_Walker is a team_leader in the organization Institute2, which is preferred over the prohibition support's role of secondee in the organization University3.

    * **Context Preference**:
       * The permission support indicates the context ""management"" holds, which is more preferred than the ""default"" context in the prohibition supports.

     * **Other Elements**: Both permission and prohibition supports share:
        * The organization Consortium considers ""edit"" as a ""modify"" activity.
        * Both organizations use report3 in their respective views (WP2 for permission, WP1 for one prohibition, and ""data"" for another prohibition).
        * Since these elements are identical, they don't contribute to dominance.

    **Conclusion**: The permission support dominates both prohibition supports due to the preferred role (""team_leader"" over ""secondee"" and ""PhD_student"") and the preferred context (""management"" over ""default""). Therefore, Chloe_Walker's access is granted for modifying report3 within view WP2.

 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2272;455;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for each prohibition support, there exists at least one corresponding permission support where the permission support's dominance over the prohibition support is established. Dominance is achieved when each element in the permission support strictly prefers at least one equivalent element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access to perform the ""sign"" activity on ""report6"" is granted to Quinn_Thomas. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**: 

    * **Quinn_Thomas' Roles**: Quinn_Thomas holds the roles of ""researcher"" at Institute3, ""team_leader"" at Institute2, and ""PhD_student"" at University1. 
    * **Contextual Preferences**: The ""management"" context is preferred over the ""default"" context in all relevant scenarios.

    Let's break down how the decision was reached:

    *  **Prohibition 1 (University1):** Quinn_Thomas is a PhD_student at University1, prohibited from ""signing"" report6 under the default context.
        *  **Permission 1 (Institute3):**  Quinn_Thomas is also a researcher at Institute3. This role is preferred over PhD_student and operates under the preferred management context, allowing access to ""sign"" report6.

    *   **Prohibitions 2 & 3 (Institute3 & Institute1):** These prohibitions are based on Quinn_Thomas' role as staff_member at Institute3 and associate_professor at Institute1, respectively. However, these roles are less preferred than researcher or team_leader. Additionally, the context is ""default"" which is less preferred than ""management"". Therefore, these prohibitions do not impact the decision. 

     * **Permission 2 (Institute2):** This permission grants Quinn_Thomas access as a team_leader at Institute2 under the management context, further solidifying the decision to grant access. 



    In summary, the decision is based on the higher preference of Quinn_Thomas’ role as researcher at Institute 3 and the preferred context of ""management"" which outweighs the prohibition based on his role as PhD_student in University1.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation Institute2 employes Amelia_King in the role researcher, `` is preferred to ``The organisation Institute1 employes Amelia_King in the role PhD_student, `` because: researcher is preferred to PhD_student. 
The relation ``The context secondment holds between Amelia_King, read, and dataset1 in the organisation Institute2, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Amelia_King, read, and dataset1 in the organisation Institute1, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
The relation ``The organisation Institute2 employes Amelia_King in the role researcher, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University3 employes Amelia_King in the role secondee, `` because: researcher is preferred to secondee.

**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Amelia_King to perform read on dataset1 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1953;387;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of permission supports over prohibition supports. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: 
   Access is granted to Amelia_King for performing the ""read"" activity on ""dataset1"". 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    * **Permission 1 (Institute2):**
        * Role: Researcher (preferred over PhD_student and Secondee)
        * Context: Secondment (preferred over Default, Collaboration, and Management)
    *  **Permission 2 (Institute1):**
       * Role: Full Professor (preferred over Researcher and PhD_student)
       * Context: Management (Preferred over Default, Secondment, and Collaboration)
     * **Prohibitions:**
        * **Prohibition 1 (University3):**
            * Role: Secondee (less preferred than Researcher and Full Professor)
            * Context: Collaboration 
        *  **Prohibition 2 (University1):** 
           * Role: PhD_Student (Less preferred than Full Professor, Researcher)
           * Context: Default 

    **Dominance Analysis:**
    * Permission 1 from Institute2 dominates Prohibition 2 from University1 because:
        * Researcher > PhD_Student
        * Secondment > Default
        * All other elements are either identical or not relevant to the comparison.
     * Permission 2 from Institute1 dominates Prohibition 1 from University3 because:
         * Full Professor > Secondee
         * Management > Collaboration
         *  All other elements are identical or irrelevant.



    Therefore, both permissions dominate their respective prohibitions, leading to the overall grant of access.

### Output:";1841;446;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of permission support over prohibition support. A permission is granted if for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support where each element in the permission support strictly dominates at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support.

2.  **Outcome**:  
    The access to perform the ""insert"" activity on ""agreement1"" is granted to Katherine_Moore. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    * **Katherine_Moore's Roles**:
        * Katherine_Moore holds the roles of ""coordinator"", ""team_leader"", and ""researcher"" in different organizations (University3, University3, and Institute2 respectively). These roles are all preferred to the ""post_doc"" role held by Katherine_Moore at Institute2. 
    *  **Contextual Preferences**:
       * The ""management"" context is preferred over the ""collaboration"" context. This preference applies to both University3 and Institute2.

    * **Dominance Analysis**:
        Let's analyze how the permission and prohibition supports relate to each other:

        * **Prohibition**:  Katherine_Moore is prohibited from modifying ""WP1"" in the ""collaboration context"" at Institute2 due to her role as a ""postdoc"".
        * **Permissions**:
            * **University3 (Coordinator)**: Katherine_Moore is granted permission to modify ""data"" under the ""management context"" at University3. This permission dominates the prohibition because:
                * The role ""coordinator"" is preferred to ""postdoc.""
                *  The context ""management"" is preferred over ""collaboration.""
            *  **University3 (Team Leader)**: Similar to the coordinator role, this permission also dominates the prohibition due to the preferred role and context.
            *   **Institute2 (Researcher)**: This permission also dominates due to the researcher role being preferred to postdoc and the ""audit context"" being preferred to ""collaboration.""

        Since each prohibition is dominated by at least one permission, the overall decision is to grant Katherine_Moore access to modify ""agreement1.""

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1845;444;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted based on the dominance of permission supports over prohibition supports. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: 
The access to perform the ""drop"" activity on ""dataset1"" is granted to Chloe_Walker.

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
   * **Chloe_Walker's Roles**:
      *  The organization Institute2 employs Chloe_Walker as a ""wp_leader"", which is preferred to the ""associate_professor"" role she holds at the University1. 
      * Chloe_Walker is also a ""researcher"" at both the University1 and Institute3, which are preferred roles compared to ""associate professor"".

   * **Contextual Preferences**:
     * The ""audit"" context is preferred over the ""collaboration"" context in both the Institute2 and University1 scenarios.
     *  The ""secondment"" context at Institute3 is preferred over ""collaboration"" at University1.

   *  **Dominance Analysis**:
      Let's analyze the relevant supports:

      * **Permission Support (Institute2):** 
         * Role: ""wp leader"" (preferred over ""associate professor"")
         * Context: ""audit"" (preferred to ""collaboration"")
      * **Prohibition Support (University1):**
         *  Role: ""associate professor"" (less preferred than ""wp leader"", ""researcher"")
          *  Context: ""collaboration"" 

      Since the permission support's role and context are both preferred to the prohibition support's elements, the permission dominates the prohibition. 

      Similarly, the other permission supports (University1 researcher, Institute3 researcher) also dominate the prohibition support due to preferred roles and contexts. 



Therefore, based on the established decision rule and the dominance of the permission supports over the prohibition supports, access to perform ""drop"" is granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";3325;491;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support where the permission support dominates the prohibitions support.  Dominance means each element in the permission support is strictly preferable to atleast one element in the prohibition support.
2.  **Outcome**: The access to perform ""manage"" on ""prescription_3"" is granted to Victor_Turner. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:  The decision is based on comparing the supports of various permissions and prohibitions. Here's a breakdown:
    *   **Permissions:** Victor_Turner has multiple permissions granted by different hospitals:
        *   **North Hospital:** Specialist role with ""manage"" permission on ""prescription-3"" in the context of ""intern-presc-hour"".
        *    **West Hospital:** Anesthetist role with ""mange"" permission on  ""prescription-3"", in the context  of ""referent-doctor"". 
        *     **East Hospital:**  Anesthetist role  with ""manage""  permission on  ""medical_data"" in  the context of ""referent_doctor"".
    *    **Prohibitions:** There are several prohibitions against Victor_Turner performing ""manage"" in specific contexts:
        
        * **North Hospital:** Medical Secretary role with prohibition on ""manage"" (""prescription-3"") in ""sample_analysis"" context.
        *  **South Hospital:** Extern and Student roles with prohibitions on  ""manage"" (""medical_file"") in the ""afternoon"" context. 
    *  **Preference Analysis:** The decision hinges on comparing the roles, contexts, and objects involved in the permissions and prohibitions:
       *   **Role Preference:** Specialist, Anesthetist roles are preferred over Medical Secretary, Extern, and Student roles. 
       *  **Context Preference:** ""Intern-presc hour"", ""Referent-doctor"", are preferred over ""Sample_analysis"" and ""Afternoon"".
       * **Object Preference:** ""Prescription-3"" is preferred over ""medical_file"". 

    * **Dominance:** Because Victor_Turner's permissions have more preferred elements (roles, contexts, objects) compared to the prohibitions, the overall decision is in favor of granting access.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2915;349;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support where the permission support dominates the prohibitions support. Domination means each element in the permission support is preferred to at lease one element in the prohibition support.
2.  **Outcome**: The access is granted for Charlie Brown to perform ""delegate"" on ""patinet_medical data_2"". 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    *   **Role Preference**:
        *   Charlie Brown is employed as a ""hospital_doctor"" by the ""east_hospital"", which is preferred to the ""extern"" role held by Charlie Brown at ""west_hospital"". 
        * Similarly, Charlie Brown is a ""liberal_doctor"" at ""north_hospital"", preferred to ""extern"" at ""west hospital"".
        * Charlie Brown is also a ""student"" at both ""east"" and ""south"" hospitals, but this role is less preferred than ""doctor"" roles. 
    *  **Context Preference**:
       *  The ""anesthesic patient"" context at ""east hospital"" is preferred over the ""no_anesthesia"" context at both ""west"" hospitals. 
       * The ""referent_doctor"" context at  ""north_hospital"" is preferred to ""no anesthesia"" at ""West hospital"".
       * Other contexts like ""sample_analysis"" and ""morning"" are less preferred compared to the contexts mentioned above.

    *   These preferences lead to the dominance of the permission supports over the prohibition supports, granting access for Charlie Brown.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization east_hospital grants the role liberal_doctor the Permission to perform the activity handle on the view prescribtion_data if the context emergency holds,The organisation east_hospital employes Rachel_Baker in the role liberal_doctor, The organisation central_hospital considers delegate as a handle activity, The organisation east_hospital uses prescription_3 in the view prescribtion_data, The context emergency holds between Rachel_Baker, delegate, and prescription_3 in the organisation east_hospital,  
3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
(support 1): The organization south_hospital grants the role patient the Prohibition to perform the activity handle on the view admin_data if the context no_anesthesia holds,The organisation south_hospital employes Rachel_Baker in the role patient, The organisation central_hospital considers delegate as a handle activity, The organisation south_hospital uses prescription_3 in the view admin_data, The context no_anesthesia holds between Rachel_Baker, delegate, and prescription_3 in the organisation south_hospital,  
4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation east_hospital employes Rachel_Baker in the role liberal_doctor, `` is preferred to ``The organisation south_hospital employes Rachel_Baker in the role patient, `` because: liberal_doctor is preferred to patient. 
The relation ``The context emergency holds between Rachel_Baker, delegate, and prescription_3 in the organisation east_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context no_anesthesia holds between Rachel_Baker, delegate, and prescription_3 in the organisation south_hospital, `` because: emergency is preferred to no_anesthesia. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Rachel_Baker to perform delegate on prescription_3 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1478;400;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support according to the defined preferences. 
2.  **Outcome**:  
    The access to perform the ""handle"" activity on ""prescription_3"" is granted.
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    * **Role Preference:**
        * The permission support states: ""The organization east hospital employs Rachel_Baker as a liberal_doctor."" 
        * This is preferred to the prohibition support's statement: ""The organisation south hospital employs Rachel Baker as a patient.""
        * Reason: ""liberal_doctor"" is a more privileged role compared to ""patient"" in this context.
    *  **Context Preference:**
       *  The permission support indicates: ""The context 'emergency' holds between Rachel Baker, 'delegate', and 'prescription_3' in the organization east hospital.""
       * The prohibition support states:  ""The context 'no_anesthesia' holds...""
       * Reason: The ""emergency"" context is considered more urgent and demanding than the ""no anesthesia"" context. 

    * **Matching Elements:** Both the permission and prohibition support share the following elements:
        * ""The organization central hospital considers 'delegate' as a 'handle' activity""
        *  ""The organization east/south hospital uses 'prescription 3'"" in the respective views.
        * Since these elements are identical, they do not contribute to the dominance comparison.

    **Conclusion:** Because the permission support's role and context are both strictly preferred to those of the prohibition support, the access is granted according to the dominance rule.

### Output:";2053;432;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for each support for a prohibition, a corresponding permission support exists where the permission’s support strictly dominates the prohibition’s support. This means each element in the permission support is preferred over at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support.

2.  **Outcome**: The access is granted to Zane_Gonzalez for performing the activity ""prepare_operation"" (specifically ""anaesthetize"") on the view ""medical_data"".

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:

    *   **Zane_Gonzalez's Role**:
        *   Permission: Zane_Gonzalez is employed as a ""surgeon"" by the ""east_hospital"". This role is preferred over the roles of ""extern"" (west_hospital), ""patient"" (north_hospital), and ""medical_secretary"" (south_hospital).
    *  **Contextual Preferences**:
       *  Permission: The context ""intern_prescription_hour"" holds in the east_hospital. This context is preferred over:
           *   ""sample_analysis"" in the west_hospital.
           *  ""afternoon"" in the north_hospital. 
           * ""no_anesthesia"" in the south_hospital.

    * **Activity Mapping**: 
       * The organization ""central_hospital"" considers ""anesthetize"" as a type of ""prepare operation"". This mapping is consistent across both permission and prohibition scenarios.


    * **Data Usage**: 
      * Both the permission and prohibitions involve using ""patinet_medical data_3"" in the respective views (""medical_data"" for permission, ""sample"" for some prohibitions, and ""medical file"" for another prohibition). This element doesn't create a preference difference.



    * **Dominance**: Due to the preferred role, preferred context, and consistent activity/data mapping, the permission support strictly dominates each prohibition support. This satisfies the decision rule, leading to the granting of access.

        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

2.  **Outcome**: The access to modify prescription_3 through various views (medical_file, sample) is granted to Dylan_Nelson. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    *   **Prohibition Analysis:**
        *   Prohibition 1: Dylan_Nelson as a patient at west_hospital is prohibited from modifying prescription_3 due to the ""afternoon"" context.
        *    Prohibition 2:  Dylan_Nelson as medical_secretary at south_hospital has a prohibition against modifying ""personal_data"" in the ""morning"" context. This prohibition doesn't directly relate to the requested access. 
    *  **Permission Analysis:**  
        *  Permission 1: North_hospital grants Dylan_Nelson (as nurse) permission to modify ""prescription_3"" in ""medical_file"" during ""emergency"" context. 
            *   This permission is dominant over Prohibition 1 because:
                *   ""nurse"" role is preferred to ""patient"" role.
                *  ""emergency"" context is preferred over ""afternoon"". 
        *     Permission 2: South_hospital allows Dylan_Nelson  (as hospital_doctor) to modify  ""prescription_3 "" in ""sample"" view during ""anesthesic patient"" context. Dominant over Prohibition 2 because:
            *  ""hospital_doctor"" role is more preferred than ""medical_secretary"".
            * ""anesthetic_patient"" context outweighs ""morning"".
        *      Permission 3: East_hospital permits Dylan_Nelson's (as doctor) modification of  ""prescription 3"" in  ""sample"" view within the ""intern_presc hour"" context.  Dominates Prohibition 1 due to: 
                * ""doctor"" role preference over ""patient"".
                *""intern_prescr_hour"" context preference over ""afternoon""

**Conclusion:** Each prohibition is countered by at least one permission with a dominant support, thus granting Dylan_Nelson access.

(support 2): The organization east_hospital grants the role student the Prohibition to perform the activity operate on the view sample if the context no_anesthesia holds,The organisation east_hospital employes Xander_Rodriguez in the role student, The organisation central_hospital considers aOperate as a operate activity, The organisation east_hospital uses patinet_admin_data_4 in the view sample, The context no_anesthesia holds between Xander_Rodriguez, aOperate, and patinet_admin_data_4 in the organisation east_hospital,  
(support 3): The organization north_hospital grants the role patient the Prohibition to perform the activity operate on the view medical_data if the context afternoon holds,The organisation north_hospital employes Xander_Rodriguez in the role patient, The organisation central_hospital considers aOperate as a operate activity, The organisation north_hospital uses patinet_admin_data_4 in the view medical_data, The context afternoon holds between Xander_Rodriguez, aOperate, and patinet_admin_data_4 in the organisation north_hospital,  
4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation south_hospital employes Xander_Rodriguez in the role anesthetist, `` is preferred to ``The organisation east_hospital employes Xander_Rodriguez in the role medical_secretary, `` because: anesthetist is preferred to medical_secretary. 
The relation ``The context referent_doctor holds between Xander_Rodriguez, aOperate, and patinet_admin_data_4 in the organisation south_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context afternoon holds between Xander_Rodriguez, aOperate, and patinet_admin_data_4 in the organisation east_hospital, `` because: referent_doctor is preferred to afternoon. 
The relation ``The organisation south_hospital employes Xander_Rodriguez in the role anesthetist, `` is preferred to ``The organisation east_hospital employes Xander_Rodriguez in the role student, `` because: anesthetist is preferred to student. 
The relation ``The context referent_doctor holds between Xander_Rodriguez, aOperate, and patinet_admin_data_4 in the organisation south_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context no_anesthesia holds between Xander_Rodriguez, aOperate, and patinet_admin_data_4 in the organisation east_hospital, `` because: referent_doctor is preferred to no_anesthesia. 
The relation ``The organisation south_hospital employes Xander_Rodriguez in the role anesthetist, `` is preferred to ``The organisation north_hospital employes Xander_Rodriguez in the role patient, `` because: anesthetist is preferred to patient. 
The relation ``The context referent_doctor holds between Xander_Rodriguez, aOperate, and patinet_admin_data_4 in the organisation south_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context afternoon holds between Xander_Rodriguez, aOperate, and patinet_admin_data_4 in the organisation north_hospital, `` because: referent_doctor is preferred to afternoon. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Xander_Rodriguez to perform aOperate on patinet_admin_data_4 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2014;453;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches an element in the corresponding prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: 
     Access is granted. Xander_Rodriguez is permitted to perform the ""aOperate"" activity on ""patinet\_admin\_data\_4"" within the ""prescribtion\_data"" view due to the dominance of his permission support over any relevant prohibition supports.

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    * **Permission Support**:
        * **Role Assignment**: The organization ""south\_hospital"" employs Xander\_Rodriguez as an ""anesthetist"". This role is preferred over the roles assigned in the prohibition supports (""medical\_secretary"", ""student"", ""patient"").
        *  **Context**: The context ""referent\_doctor"" holds between Xander\_Rodriguez, ""aOperate"", and ""patinet_admin\_data_4"" in the ""south_hospital"" organization. This context is preferred to the contexts associated with the prohibitions (""afternoon"", ""no_anesthesia"", ""afternoon"").

    * **Prohibition Supports**:
        We need to compare the permission support to each individual prohibition support:

        * **Support 1**: Xander\_Rodriguez is a ""medical\_secretary"" at ""east\_hospital"" under the ""afternoon"" context. This prohibition is outweighed by the permission support due to the preferred role (""anesthetist"") and context (""referent\_doctor"").

        *   **Support 2**:  Xander\_Rodriguez is designated as a ""student"" at ""north\_hospital"" with the ""no\_anesthesia"" context.  Again, the permission support's preferred role and context dominate this prohibition.

        *    **Support 3**: Xander\_Rodriquez is a ""patient"" at ""west\_hospital"" during the ""afternoon"".  Similar to the previous prohibitions, the permission is granted due to the superior role and context.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";2011;294;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support.  
    A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches an element in the corresponding prohibition support.

2.  **Outcome**:  
    The access to perform the ""transfer"" activity on ""patinet\_medical\_data\_2"" is granted to Mia\_Anderson.

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    * **Role Preference:**
        * The organization north\_hospital employs Mia\_Anderson as a ""hospital\_doctor,"" which is preferred over the roles of ""patient"" in the east\_hospital, west\_hospital, and south\_hospital. 

    * **Context Preference:**
       * The context ""anesthesic\_patient"" in north\_hospital is preferred over:
           * ""no\_anesthesia"" in east\_hospital
           *  ""morning"" in west\_hospital and south\_hospitals.

    *  **Dominance Analysis:**
        Because the north\_hospital's role and context are preferred over those in the east, west, and south hospitals, the permission support dominates all the prohibition supports. This means that Mia\_Anderson's access is granted according to the decision rule.

2.  **Outcome**: 
The access to perform ""aOperate"" on ""sample_2"" is granted to Ben_Foster. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**: 

*   **Permission Supports Dominate Prohibition Support:**
    *   **Role Preference:**
        *   The permission supports involve Ben_Foster as a ""nurse"" (north_hospital) or ""intern"" (east_hospital), which are both preferred roles compared to the ""medical_secretary"" role in the prohibition (south_hospital). 
    *    **Context Preference:** 
       *   The contexts ""anesthesic\_patient"" (north\_hospital) and ""intern\_presc\_hour"" (east\_hospital) are both preferred to the ""morning"" context (south\_hospital). 

*    **Shared Elements:** All supports share the same activity (""aOperate"") and the same object (""sample_2"") as defined by the central_hospital. Since these elements are identical, they don't contribute to dominance. 

* **Conclusion:** Because the permission supports dominate the prohibition support in terms of both role and context preferences, the access is granted according to the decision rule.

        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob_Smith to perform prescribe_medecine on patinet_admin_data_3 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2577;632;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for every prohibition support, there exists at least one corresponding permission support where the permission support's elements dominate the prohibition support. Domination means that every element in the permission support must be strictly preferred to, or match, at least one equivalent element in the prohibition support based on the defined preferences. 
2.  **Outcome**: The access to perform ""prescribe_medecine"" on ""patinet\_admin\_data\_3"" is granted to Bob\_Smith. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**: The decision is based on the comparison of various permission and prohibition supports. 
    *   **Permissions:**
        *   **north_hospital (Nurse):** 
            *   Bob\_Smith is employed as a nurse in north\_hospital.
            *    The context ""anesthesic\_patient"" holds.
        *    **north\_hospital (Doctor):**
            *  Bob\_Smith works as a doctor at north\_hospital
            * The context ""referent\_doctor"" holds. 
       *   **west\_hospital (Anesthetist):**
           * Bob\_Smith is an anesthetist at west\_hospital. 
           *  The context ""emergency"" holds.  
    *  **Prohibitions:** 
      *   **south\_hospital (Student):**
          *  Bob \_Smith is a student at south\_hospital.  
          *   The context ""no\_anesthesia"" holds.   
      *  **west\_Hospital (Student): **
          * Bob\_ Smith is a student in west\_hospital
          * The context  ""sample\_analysis"" holds.

    * **Dominance Analysis:**
        Let's analyze how the permission supports dominate the prohibition supports:

        * **south\_hospital Prohibition vs. north\_hospital Nurse Permission:**
            * ""Nurse"" (north\_hospital) is preferred to ""Student"" (south\_hospital).
            * Context ""Anesthesic\_Patient"" is preferred to  ""No\_Anesthesia"".
            * Therefore, the north\_hospital nurse permission dominates the south\_hospital student prohibition.

        *  **south\_Hospital Prohibition vs.  north\_hospital Doctor Permission:**
           * ""Doctor"" is preferred over ""Student"".
           * Context ""Referent\_Doctor"" is more preferred than ""No\_anesthesia.""
           * The north\_hospital doctor permission dominates. 

       * **west\_Hospital Student Prohibition vs. west\_Hospital Anesthetist Permission:**
          * ""Anesthetist"" (west\_hospital) overrides ""Student""
          * Context ""Emergency"" overrides ""Sample\_Analysis"" 
          * West\_hospital anesthetist permission dominates.



    * **Conclusion:** Since each prohibition support is dominated by at least one permission support, the overall decision is to grant Bob\_Smith access to ""prescribe\_medecine"" based on his roles, contexts, and the defined preference hierarchy.

### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1793;400;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of permission support over prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: 
     Access is granted to Yara Lee to perform the ""cancer_analysis"" activity on ""patinet_medical data_3"" in the ""admin_data"" view. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    * **Role Preference**:
        * The permission support states that Yara Lee holds the role ""specialist"" in the organization ""east_hospital"". This is preferred over the role ""medical_secretary"" held by Yara Lee in the ""west_hospital"" (prohibition 1) and the role ""student"" held by her in the ""north_hospital""(prohibition 2). 
        *  ""specialist"" is considered a higher-level role compared to ""medical secretary"" and ""student"" in this context. 
    *  **Context Preference**:
       * The permission context is ""intern_presc _hour"" within the ""east hospital"", while the prohibition contexts are ""afternoon"" (west_hospital) and ""morning"" (north_hospital). 
       * ""Intern_prescription_hour"" is considered more specific and controlled than ""afternoon"" or ""morning"", implying a higher level of access control. 

    * **Shared Elements**: 
      * Both the permission and prohibitions share the same activity (""cancer_analysis""), organization (""central_hospital""), and data point (""patinet medical data_3""). These elements are considered equivalent and do not contribute to the dominance comparison. 



    Since the permission support's role and context are both preferred over the prohibition supports, the overall permission support dominates both prohibition supports, leading to the granting of access.

       * *Referent\_doctor* is STRONGLy PREFERRED over *no_anesthesia*. This preference further reinforces the permission.

    * **Matching Elements:** Both the permission and prohibition support share:
        * ""The organization central\_hospital considers *delegate* as a *handle* activity.""
        * The organization *south_hospital* and *west_hospital* both use *patinet\admin\_data\*_2* in their respective views.
        * Since these elements are identical in both supports, they do not contribute to dominance.



    **Conclusion:** Because the permission support's role and context are both strictly preferred to the prohibition support's corresponding elements, the access is granted according to the dominance rule.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support:

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Henry_Lee to perform sign on patinet_admin_data_3 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1963;453;"1.  **Decision Rule**:
    Access is granted based on the dominance principle: For each prohibition, there must exist a corresponding permission whose support strictly dominates the prohibition’s support.  Dominance means each element in the permission’s support is more preferred than at least one corresponding element in the prohibition.

2.  **Outcome**: Access is granted to Henry Lee to perform the ""sign"" activity on ""patinet\_admin\_data\_3"".

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:

    *   **Role Preference:**
        *   Henry Lee is employed as a ""surgeon"" by the ""east_hospital"", which is preferred over the ""extern"" role he holds at ""west_hospital"".
        * Similarly, Henry Lee's role as a ""nurse"" at ""north_hospital"" is preferred over ""extern"". 
        *  His role as an ""intern"" is also preferred to ""extern"".

    *  **Context Preference:**
       *  The ""referent_doctor"" context at ""east hospital"" is preferred to ""morning"" at ""west hospital"".
       * The ""emergency"" context at both ""north hospital"" instances (nurse and intern roles) is preferred to the ""morning"" context.

    * **Shared Elements:** Both permission and prohibition supports share:
        * The organization ""central_hospital"" considers ""sign"" as a ""validate"" activity.
        * Both use ""patinet_admin\_data_3"" in the respective views (""prescribtion\_data"" and ""admin\_data"").

    **Decision Justification:**

    The permission granted for Henry Lee to ""sign"" is based on the following:
    *   His preferred roles (""surgeon"", ""nurse"", ""intern"") at ""east"", ""north"" hospitals, respectively, outweigh his ""extern"" status at ""west"".
    *  The preferred contexts (""referent_doctor"", ""emergency"") further strengthen the case for granting access.
    * Since the shared elements are identical, they don't influence the dominance comparison.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";3228;391;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support where the permission support dominates the prohibitions support.  Dominance means each element in the permission support is preferred to *at least one* element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: Access is GRANTED. Ben_Foster is granted permission to perform the ""ask"" activity on ""patinet\_admin\_data\_1"". 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:  
    * **Role Preference**:  Several permissions involve Ben_Foster as a ""surgeon"", which is preferred to roles like ""student"", ""extern"", or ""patient"". This preference is key in comparing permission and prohibition supports. 

    * **Context Preference**:  
        * ""emergency"" is preferred to ""no_anesthesia"" and ""morning"". This means permissions with ""emergency"" contexts are more likely to be granted than those with other contexts.
        *  ""intern\_presc\_hour"" is preferred over ""morning"".
    *  **Matching Elements**: Some elements are identical across permissions and prohibitions (e.g., ""Ben_Foster"", ""ask"", ""patinet_admin\_data_1""). These don't contribute to dominance, but they are still part of the comparison.


    * **Breakdown of Key Comparisons**:
        * **Permission 1 (South Hospital):**  ""emergency"" context and ""surgeon"" role are both preferred over the prohibitions from North, West, and East Hospitals. This grants Ben_Foster access in this scenario.

        * **Permissions 2 & 3 (East Hospital):** Similar to Permission 1, the ""intern_prescription_hour"" context and surgeon role are preferred, granting access in these cases.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";3277;354;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support where the permission support dominates the prohibitions support.  Dominance means each element in the permission support is strictly preferable to atleast one element in the prohibition support.
2.  **Outcome**: The access is granted for Olivia Scott to perform ""delegate"" on ""prescription_3"". 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    *   **Role Preferences**:
        *   The roles ""liberal_doctor"" and ""anesthetist"" are both preferred to ""patient"" and ""medical_secretary"". This preference is based on the organization's hierarchy and responsibilities. 
    *  **Context Preferences**:
       *   ""emergency"" is preferred to ""afternoon"", ""morning"", ""no_anesthesia"", and ""referent_doctor"". This reflects the urgency associated with emergency situations requiring immediate action.
       *  ""referent_doctor"" is preferred over ""afternoon"" and ""morning"". This indicates a higher level of authority and responsibility associated with a referent doctor's role. 


    *   These preferences are applied to compare the supports of permissions and prohibitions. For example, since Olivia Scott holds the role of ""liberal doctor"" (preferred to ""patient"") and the context is ""emergency""  (preferred to ""afternoon""), the permission to perform ""handle"" on ""personal_data"" is granted, overriding the prohibition against ""handle"" in ""admin_data"" under ""afternoon"". 

    *   Similar comparisons are made for other permissions and prohibitions, ultimately leading to the decision to grant access for Olivia Scott based on the dominance of her permission supports over the prohibition supports.

### Input:1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if,         for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.         Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization east_hospital grants the role intern the Permission to perform the activity operate on the view sample if the context intern_presc_hour holds,The organisation east_hospital employes Xander_Rodriguez in the role intern, The organisation central_hospital considers aOperate as a operate activity, The organisation east_hospital uses sample_1 in the view sample, The context intern_presc_hour holds between Xander_Rodriguez, aOperate, and sample_1 in the organisation east_hospital,  
(support 2): The organization east_hospital grants the role intern the Permission to perform the activity operate on the view admin_data if the context intern_presc_hour holds,The organisation east_hospital employes Xander_Rodriguez in the role intern, The organisation central_hospital considers aOperate as a operate activity, The organisation east_hospital uses sample_1 in the view admin_data, The context intern_presc_hour holds between Xander_Rodriguez, aOperate, and sample_1 in the organisation east_hospital,  
(support 3): The organization west_hospital grants the role intern the Permission to perform the activity operate on the view admin_data if the context emergency holds,The organisation west_hospital employes Xander_Rodriguez in the role intern, The organisation central_hospital considers aOperate as a operate activity, The organisation west_hospital uses sample_1 in the view admin_data, The context emergency holds between Xander_Rodriguez, aOperate, and sample_1 in the organisation west_hospital,  
3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
(support 1): The organization east_hospital grants the role extern the Prohibition to perform the activity operate on the view admin_data if the context morning holds,The organisation east_hospital employes Xander_Rodriguez in the role extern, The organisation central_hospital considers aOperate as a operate activity, The organisation east_hospital uses sample_1 in the view admin_data, The context morning holds between Xander_Rodriguez, aOperate, and sample_1 in the organisation east_hospital,  
4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation east_hospital employes Xander_Rodriguez in the role intern, `` is preferred to ``The organisation east_hospital employes Xander_Rodriguez in the role extern, `` because: intern is preferred to extern. 
The relation ``The context intern_presc_hour holds between Xander_Rodriguez, aOperate, and sample_1 in the organisation east_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context morning holds between Xander_Rodriguez, aOperate, and sample_1 in the organisation east_hospital, `` because: intern_presc_hour is preferred to morning. 
The relation ``The organisation east_hospital employes Xander_Rodriguez in the role intern, `` is preferred to ``The organisation east_hospital employes Xander_Rodriguez in the role extern, `` because: intern is preferred to extern. 
The relation ``The context intern_presc_hour holds between Xander_Rodriguez, aOperate, and sample_1 in the organisation east_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context morning holds between Xander_Rodriguez, aOperate, and sample_1 in the organisation east_hospital, `` because: intern_presc_hour is preferred to morning. 
The relation ``The organisation west_hospital employes Xander_Rodriguez in the role intern, `` is preferred to ``The organisation east_hospital employes Xander_Rodriguez in the role extern, `` because: intern is preferred to extern. 
The relation ``The context emergency holds between Xander_Rodriguez, aOperate, and sample_1 in the organisation west_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context morning holds between Xander_Rodriguez, aOperate, and sample_1 in the organisation east_hospital, `` because: emergency is preferred to morning. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Xander_Rodriguez to perform aOperate on sample_1 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1923;428;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted based on the dominance of permission supports over prohibition supports. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: 
The access to perform ""aOperate"" on ""sample_1"" is granted. This decision is based on the presence of multiple permission supports that dominate the single prohibition support.

3.  **Relations & Preferences**: 

*   **Role Preference**: 
    *   The permission supports involve Xander_Rodriguez as an ""intern"" while the prohibition support involves him as an ""extern"".  ""Intern"" is preferred to ""extern"" in this context.
*   **Context Preference**:
    *  The permission supports utilize contexts like ""intern_presc\_hour"" and ""emergency"", while the prohibition uses ""morning"". These contexts are preferred in the following order:
        *   ""emergency"" 
        *  ""intern\_presc\_ hour""
        * ""morning"" 

*  **Dominance Analysis**:
    Let's break down how the permission supports dominate the prohibition:

    *   **Permission Support 1 (sample):**
        * Role: Intern (preferred over Extern)
        * Context: Intern_Presc_Hour (preferred over Morning)
        
        * This permission support completely dominates the prohibition support due to the preferred role and context.

    * **Permission Support 2 (admin_data):** Similar to Support 1, the role and context are preferred, leading to dominance over the prohibition. 

    *  **Prohibition Support:** 
       * Role: Extern (less preferred than Intern)
       * Context: Morning (least preferred context)



    Since all three permission supports demonstrate dominance over the single prohibition, Xander_Rodriguez's access is granted according to the decision rule.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2411;401;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support where the permission support strictly dominates the prohibition support. Domination occurs when each element in the permission support is preferred to, at least, one element in the prohibition support based on the defined preferences. 
2.  **Outcome**: The access to perform the ""analyze"" activity on ""prescription_4"" is granted to Olivia_Scott. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:  The decision is based on the comparison of different permission and prohibition supports. 
    * **Olivia_Scott's Roles**: Olivia_Scott holds the roles of ""surgeon"" and ""hospital_doctor"" in different organizations. These roles are preferred to the roles ""medical_secretary"" and ""extern"" held by individuals in the prohibition supports.
    *  **Contexts**: The contexts ""anesthesic patient"" and ""intern_presc hour"" are preferred over the contexts ""morning"" and ""afternoon"" respectively. This preference stems from the nature of the activities and the specific requirements associated with each context. 
     * **Domination**:  
        * For the prohibition by ""west_hospital"" (medical_secretary, morning), the permission granted by ""north_hospital""  (surgeon, anesthesic patient) dominates because:
            * ""Surgeon"" is preferred to ""medical secretary"".
            *  ""Anesthesic patient "" is preferred to  ""morning"". 
        * Similarly, for the prohibitions by ""east_hospital"" (""extern"", ""afternoon""), the permissions granted by ""south_hospital"" both (""hospital_doctor"", ""intern_precs_hour"") and (""surgeon"", ""anesthetic_patient"") dominate due to the preferred roles and contexts. 



This detailed explanation demonstrates how the access decision is made based on the specified logic, preferences, and the comparison of supports.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2498;435;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support where the permission’s support strictly dominates the prohibition’s support.  Dominance means each element in the permission support is preferred to *at least one* element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access is granted to Zane Gonzalez to perform the ""sign"" activity on ""patinet\_medical\_data\_2"" in the ""admin\_data"" view. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:  
    * **Role Preference:**
        * Zane Gonzalez is employed as a ""hospital_doctor"" by the ""east_hospital"" and as a ""specialist"" by ""west_hospital"". These roles are both preferred to ""extern"" and ""student"". 
    *  **Context Preference:**
       * The ""referent_doctor"" context is preferred to ""no_anesthesia"" and ""morning"" contexts. 

    * **Breaking Down the Decision:**
        Let's analyze the relevant prohibitions and permissions:

        * **Prohibition 1:**  ""extern"" role, ""no anesthesia"" context, ""admin_data"" view
        * **Permission 1 (east_hospital):**  ""hospital_doctor"", ""referent\_doctor"" context,  ""admin_data” view 
        * This permission dominates the prohibition because:
            * Zane Gonzalez's role (""hospital_doctor"") is preferred to his role in the prohibition (""extern"").
            * The context (""referent\_doctor"") in the permission is preferred to the context (""no\_anesthesia"") in the prohibition.

        *  **Prohibition 2 & 3:** ""student"" roles, ""morning"" context, either ""medical\_file"" or ""admin\_ data"" views. These prohibitions are not relevant because they do not involve the same role, context, or view as the granted permission. 



    Therefore, based on the decision rule and the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support, Zane Gonzalez is granted access.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

2.  **Outcome**: Access is GRANTED. Yara-Lee is granted permission to perform ""aOperate"" on ""patinet_admin data_3"". 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:

    *   **Role Preferences:**
        *   Yara-Lee's role as ""liberal_doctor"" in the south_hospital is preferred to her role as ""student"" in the north_hospital (prohibition). This preference applies to both ""operate"" on ""sample"" and ""prescribtion data"".

        *   Her role as ""intern"" is preferred to both ""student"" and ""extern"" roles in the north hospital. This applies to ""operate"" actions on ""sample"", ""prescription_data"", and ""personal_data"". 

        *  Her role as a ""surgeon"" is preferred over ""student"" or ""extern"" in the organizations. This preference applies when operating on ""medical_file"".

### Output:";1517;355;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support according to the defined preferences. 
2.  **Outcome**:  
    The access to perform the ""analyze"" activity (specifically ""biopsy"") on ""patinet_medical data_5"" in the ""admin_data"" view is granted to Dylan_Nelson. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    *   **Role Preference**: The permission support states that Dylan_Nelson is employed as a ""hospital_doctor"" by the ""north_hospital"", while the prohibition support states he is a ""student"" at ""east_hospital"".  ""hospital doctor"" is strictly preferred over ""student"" in this context. 
    *  **Context Preference**: The context for the permission is ""referent_doctor"", while the context for the prohibition is ""sample_analysis"". ""Referent_doctor"" is preferred over ""sample_ analysis"" in this scenario.
    * **Matching Elements**: Both the permission and prohibition support share the following elements:
        *   The organization ""central_hospital"" considers ""biopsy"" as an ""analyze""activity.
        *  Both use ""patinet medical_data _5"" within the ""admin data"" view.

    Since the permission support's role and context are both preferred to the prohibition support's, the dominance condition is satisfied, leading to the granting of access.

An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization east_hospital grants the role intern the Permission to perform the activity handle on the view sample if the context emergency holds,The organisation east_hospital employes Grace_Davis in the role intern, The organisation central_hospital considers delegate as a handle activity, The organisation east_hospital uses patinet_admin_data_1 in the view sample, The context emergency holds between Grace_Davis, delegate, and patinet_admin_data_1 in the organisation east_hospital,  
3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
(support 1): The organization west_hospital grants the role patient the Prohibition to perform the activity handle on the view medical_data if the context afternoon holds,The organisation west_hospital employes Grace_Davis in the role patient, The organisation central_hospital considers delegate as a handle activity, The organisation west_hospital uses patinet_admin_data_1 in the view medical_data, The context afternoon holds between Grace_Davis, delegate, and patinet_admin_data_1 in the organisation west_hospital,

4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation east_hospital employes Grace_Davis in the role intern, `` is preferred to ``The organisation west_hospital employes Grace_Davis in the role patient, `` because: intern is preferred to patient. 
The relation ``The context emergency holds between Grace_Davis, delegate, and patinet_admin_data_1 in the organisation east_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context afternoon holds between Grace_Davis, delegate, and patinet_admin_data_1 in the organisation west_hospital, `` because: emergency is preferred to afternoon.

**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Grace_Davis to perform delegate on patinet_admin_data_1 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1718;367;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support across all relevant aspects (role, context, activity, data). 
2.  **Outcome**: 
The access is GRANTED. Grace_Davis is permitted to perform the ""handle"" activity on ""patinet_admin\_data\_1"" in the ""sample"" view under the ""emergency"" context. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
*   **Role Preference**: 
    *   The permission support states that Grace_Davis holds the role ""intern"" in the organization ""east_hospital"". This role is strictly preferred over the ""patient"" role in the west_hospital prohibition and the ""student"" role in south_hospital prohibition.
    *    Intern > Patient and Intern > Student. 
*    **Context Preference**:
    *  The permission support specifies the context as ""emergency"" within the east_hospital. This context is strictly preferred compared to the ""afternoon"" context used in both the west and south hospital prohibitions. 
     *   Emergency > Afternoon. 
 *   **Other Shared Elements**:
     *  Both the permission and prohibitions share the same activity (""handle"") and data (""patinet\_admin\_data \_1""). Since these elements are identical, they do not contribute to dominance. 

**Conclusion**: Because the permission support's role and context are both strictly preferred to those in the prohibition supports, the access is granted according to the dominance rule.

 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2932;368;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support where the permission support dominates. Dominance is defined as each element in the permission support being strictly preferred to, or matching, at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support.
2.  **Outcome**: The access is granted for Ben Foster to perform blood analysis on sample 5. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:  
    * **Role Preference**:
        * Ben Foster is employed as a doctor in the South Hospital, which is preferred to being an extern in the East Hospital, a student in the East hospital, or a patient in the West Hospital.
        * This preference applies to both the permissions granted by the South Hospital and the prohibitions imposed by the East and West Hospitals. 
    *  **Context Preference**: 
       * The context ""intern_prescription_hour"" holds between Ben Foster, blood analysis, and sample 5 at the South Hospital. This context is preferred to ""sample_analysis"" (East Hospital), ""afternoon"" (West Hospital), and ""anesthetic_patient"" (South Hospital for a different permission).
       * This preference is crucial because it establishes a stronger justification for Ben Foster's access compared to the prohibitions based on other contexts.

    * **Element Matching**: Some elements in both permission and prohibition supports are identical (e.g., ""blood_analysis"" as the activity, ""sample_5"" as the data). These matching elements do not require a preference comparison.



The combination of role preference, context preference, and matching elements leads to the conclusion that the permission granted to Ben Foster outweighs any prohibitions.

The relation ``The context intern_presc_hour holds between Xander_Rodriguez, biopsy, and sample_1 in the organisation south_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context afternoon holds between Xander_Rodriguez, biopsy, and sample_1 in the organisation north_hospital, `` because: intern_presc_hour is preferred to afternoon. 
The relation ``The organisation south_hospital employes Xander_Rodriguez in the role surgeon, `` is preferred to ``The organisation east_hospital employes Xander_Rodriguez in the role medical_secretary, `` because: surgeon is preferred to medical_secretary. 
The relation ``The context intern_presc_hour holds between Xander_Rodriguez, biopsy, and sample_1 in the organisation south_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context morning holds between Xander_Rodriguez, biopsy, and sample_1 in the organisation east_hospital, `` because: intern_presc_hour is preferred to morning. 
The relation ``The organisation west_hospital employes Xander_Rodriguez in the role specialist, `` is preferred to ``The organisation north_hospital employes Xander_Rodriguez in the role extern, `` because: specialist is preferred to extern. 
The relation ``The context emergency holds between Xander_Rodriguez, biopsy, and sample_1 in the organisation west_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context afternoon holds between Xander_Rodriguez, biopsy, and sample_1 in the organisation north_hospital, `` because: emergency is preferred to afternoon.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2024;466;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of permission supports over prohibition supports. 
    A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**:  
    Access to perform the ""analyze"" activity on ""sample_1"" is granted to Xander_Rodriguez. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    *   **Role Preferences:**
        *   The roles ""surgeon"" and ""specialist"" are both preferred to the roles ""extern"" and ""medical_secretary"". This preference is based on the organization's hierarchy and the perceived level of expertise associated with each role. 
            *   ""surgeon"" > ""extern"", ""specialist"" > ""medical secretary""
        *    These role preferences contribute to the dominance of the permission supports over the prohibition supports because Xander_Rodriguez's role in the permissions is preferred to his role in the prohibitions.

    *  **Context Preferences:**
       *   The contexts ""intern_prescription_hour"" and ""emergency"" are preferred to ""afternoon"" and ""morning"", respectively. These preferences reflect the specific circumstances under which certain activities are allowed or restricted. 
           *   ""intern_prescribtion_hour"" > ""afternoon"", ""emergency"" > ""morning""
       *  These context preferences further strengthen the dominance because the contexts associated with the permissions are preferred to those associated with the prohibitions. 

    * **Other Elements:** All other elements, such as the activity (""analyze""), the object (""sample_1""), and the organization (""south_hospital"", ""west_hospital"", etc.), are identical in both the permission and prohibition supports. Therefore, these elements do not contribute to dominance or non-dominance.

    **Conclusion:** 
    The combination of preferred roles and contexts in the permission supports, compared to the prohibition supports, results in a clear dominance. This dominance satisfies the decision rule, leading to the granting of access to Xander_ Rodriguez to perform the analyze activity on sample 1.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2418;342;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for each prohibition support, there exists at least one corresponding permission support where the permission support's dominance over the prohibition support is established. Dominance is achieved when each element in the permission support strictly prefers at least one counterpart element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access is granted for Alice Johnson to perform ""aOperate"" on ""sample_1"". 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:  The decision is based on comparing the supports of different permissions and prohibitions. Here's a breakdown:

    * **Permissions:**
        * **Permission 1:** Granted by ""south_hospital"" to ""Alice_Johnson"" as ""hospital_doctor"" in the ""emergency"" context. This permission is dominant over the prohibitions because:
            *  ""hospital_doctor > medical_secretary"" (role preference)
            * ""emergency > afternoon"" (context preference)
        *  **Permission 2 & 3:**  Granted by ""north_hospital"" with roles ""liberal_doctor"" and ""intern"" respectively. These permissions are also dominant due to similar role and context preference comparisons as above. 

    *  **Prohibitions:**
       * **Prohibition 1 & 2:**  These prohibitions are not dominant over any of the granted permissions due to less preferred roles (""student"" and ""medical_secretary"") and contexts (""morning"" and ""afternoon"").


    * **Key Points:** The decision favors permissions with higher-ranked roles and contexts.

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Input:1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if,         for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.         Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization east_hospital grants the role doctor the Permission to perform the activity consult on the view medical_data if the context emergency holds,The organisation east_hospital employes Zane_Gonzalez in the role doctor, The organisation central_hospital considers read_db as a consult activity, The organisation east_hospital uses patinet_medical_data_1 in the view medical_data, The context emergency holds between Zane_Gonzalez, read_db, and patinet_medical_data_1 in the organisation east_hospital,  
3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
(support 1): The organization east_hospital grants the role medical_secretary the Prohibition to perform the activity consult on the view medical_data if the context afternoon holds,The organisation east_hospital employes Zane_Gonzalez in the role medical_secretary, The organisation central_hospital considers read_db as a consult activity, The organisation east_hospital uses patinet_medical_data_1 in the view medical_data, The context afternoon holds between Zane_Gonzalez, read_db, and patinet_medical_data_1 in the organisation east_hospital,  
(support 2): The organization north_hospital grants the role patient the Prohibition to perform the activity consult on the view medical_data if the context morning holds,The organisation north_hospital employes Zane_Gonzalez in the role patient, The organisation central_hospital considers read_db as a consult activity, The organisation north_hospital uses patinet_medical_data_1 in the view medical_data, The context morning holds between Zane_Gonzalez, read_db, and patinet_medical_data_1 in the organisation north_hospital,  
4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation east_hospital employes Zane_Gonzalez in the role doctor, `` is preferred to ``The organisation east_hospital employes Zane_Gonzalez in the role medical_secretary, `` because: doctor is preferred to medical_secretary. 
The relation ``The context emergency holds between Zane_Gonzalez, read_db, and patinet_medical_data_1 in the organisation east_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context afternoon holds between Zane_Gonzalez, read_db, and patinet_medical_data_1 in the organisation east_hospital, `` because: emergency is preferred to afternoon. 
The relation ``The organisation east_hospital employes Zane_Gonzalez in the role doctor, `` is preferred to ``The organisation north_hospital employes Zane_Gonzalez in the role patient, `` because: doctor is preferred to patient. 
The relation ``The context emergency holds between Zane_Gonzalez, read_db, and patinet_medical_data_1 in the organisation east_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context morning holds between Zane_Gonzalez, read_db, and patinet_medical_data_1 in the organisation north_hospital, `` because: emergency is preferred to morning. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Zane_Gonzalez to perform read_db on patinet_medical_data_1 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1748;424;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support according to the defined preferences. 
2.  **Outcome**: 
The access to perform the ""read_db"" activity on ""patinet_medical data_1"" is granted to Zane_Gonzalez. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:  
The decision is based on the comparison of two prohibition supports and the corresponding permission support: 

* **Prohibition Support 1:** 
    * Organization: east_hospital
    * Role: medical_secretary
    * Activity: consult
    * View: medical_data
    * Context: afternoon 
    
    * **Comparison:** This prohibition is outweighed by the permission support because:
        * **Role Preference:** ""doctor"" (permission) is preferred to ""medical_secretary"" (prohibition).
        *  **Context Preference:** ""emergency"" (permission context) is preferred over ""afternoon"" (prohibiton context). 

*  **Prohibition Support  2:** 
     * Organization: north_hospital
     * Role: patient
     * Activity:consult
     * View:medical_data
     * Context: morning 
     
     *  **Comparison:**  This prohibition is also outweighed because: 
         * **Organization Preference:** ""east_hospital"" (permission organization) is considered more relevant than ""north_hospital""  (prohibition organization).
         *  **Role Preference:**  ""doctor""  is preferred to ""patient"".
         *   **Context Preference: ** ""emergency"" is preferred to  ""morning"". 



Since the permission support dominates both prohibition supports based on the defined preferences, Zane_Gonzalez is granted access.

### Output:";2582;390;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support where the permission support dominates the prohibitions support.  Dominance means each element in the permission support is preferred to at lease one element in the prohibition support.
2.  **Outcome**: The access is granted for Chloe Walker to perform blood analysis on patinet medical data 5. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    * **Chloe Walker's Roles**:
        *  Chloe Walker is employed as a **doctor** by the **east_hospital**. This role is preferred over the roles of **student** (south_hospital), **patient** (north_hospital), and **medical_secretary** (east_hospital).

    *  **Contexts**:
       * The **intern_presc\_hour** context in the east_hospital is preferred to the **sample\_analysis** context found in the south, north, and east hospitals. 
       *  The **anesthesic\_patient** context at the west_hospital is also preferred to **sample_analysis** in the south and north hospitals. 

    * **Dominance**: Because Chloe Walker's role as **doctor** (preferred over other roles) and the **intern\_presc\_ hour** context (preferred over sample\_analysis) are associated with the permission to analyze patinet\_medical\_data\_5, this permission dominates the prohibitions where Chloe Walker is in a less preferred role (student, patient, medical secretary) or the context is less preferred (sample\_analysis).

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";3063;347;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support where the permission support dominates the prohibitions support. Domination means each element in the permission support is preferred to at lease one element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access is granted for Mia Anderson to perform ""anaesthetize"" on ""patinet_medical data_2"". 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**: The decision is based on the comparison of various elements in the permission and prohibition supports. Here's a breakdown: 
    * **Role Preference**:  
        *  Mia Anderson's role as ""doctor"" in the west_hospital permission is preferred to her role as ""patient"" in the east_hospital prohibition.
        * Mia Anderson's roles as ""anesthetist"" in the south_hospital permission and ""intern"" in the north_hospital permission are both preferred to her roles as ""patient"", ""extern"", in the east and west_hospital prohibitions, respectively.
    *  **Context Preference**:
        * The ""referent_doctor"" context in the west and north_hospital permissions is preferred to the ""afternoon"" and ""sample_analysis"" contexts in the respective east and east_hospital prohibitions. 
       *  The ""anesthesic_patients"" context in south_hospital is preferred to ""afternoon"" context in west_hospital. 


    These role and context preferences ensure that the permission supports dominate the corresponding prohibition supports, satisfying the decision rule and leading to the granting of access.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1986;462;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of permission supports over prohibition supports. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if every element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: 
   Access is granted to Samuel_Evans for performing the activity `handle_db` on `sample_1`. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    * **Role Preference:**
        *  The organization grants Samuel_Evans the role of `specialist`, `liberal_doctor`, or `nurse`. These roles are all preferred to the role `student` associated with the prohibition. 
    *  **Context Preference:**
       * The context `intern_presc\_hour` is preferred to the context `sample\_analysis`. This preference applies to all instances where Samuel_Evans is involved in both contexts.

    * **Dominance Analysis:**
        Let's analyze how the permission and prohibition supports relate:

        * **Prohibition Support:**
            * Organization: North Hospital
            * Role: Student
            * Activity: Handle
            * View: Medical Data
            * Context: Sample Analysis
        * **Permission Supports:** There are three permission supports, each granting Samuel_Evans access under different conditions:
            * **Support 1 (North Hospital):**
                * Role: Specialist
                * Activity: handle
                * View: Prescribtion Data
                * Context: Intern_Presc_Hour
            *  **Support 2 (South Hospital):** 
                *  Role: Liberal Doctor
                *   Activity: handle
               *   View: Medical Data 
               *  Context: Intern Presc Hour
            *   **Support 3 (East Hospital):**  
               * Role: Nurse
               * Activity:  handle
               * View: Sample
               * Context:  Intern Presc Hour

        *  **Dominance:** Each permission support's role, context, and activity are preferred to the prohibition support's corresponding elements. Therefore, the permission supports dominate the prohibition support, leading to access being granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";3091;559;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support where the permission support dominates the prohibitions support. Domination means each element in the permission support is preferred to at lease one element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access is granted for Victor Turner to perform ""prescribe_appointment"" on ""patinet_admin data_3"". 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**: 

    * **Victor Turner's Roles**:
        * Victor Turner is employed as a ""nurse"" by ""west_hospital"", a ""hospital_doctor"" by ""east_hospital"", and a ""surgeon"" by ""north_hospital"". 
        * These roles are preferred in the following order: surgeon > hospital_doctor > nurse. 
    * **Contexts**:
       *  ""anesthesic patient"" is preferred to ""no_anesthesia"", ""afternoon"", and ""intern_presc hour"". 
       * ""intern_prescription_hour"" is preferred over ""afternoon"".

    *  **Dominance Analysis**:
        Let's analyze each prohibition and see if there's a corresponding permission that dominates it:

        * **Prohibition 1**:  ""west_hospital"" grants ""Victor Turner"" as a ""patient"" the prohibition to ""prescribe"" on ""medical_file"" in the context ""no anesthesia"". 
            * This prohibition is dominated by the permission granted by ""west hospital"" where Victor Turner is a ""nurse"", ""prescribing"" in the ""anesthetic_patient"" context on ""medical file"". 

        *  **Prohibition 2**:  ""east_hospital""  grants ""Victor Turner"", as an ""extern"", the prohibition to  ""prescribe""  on ""medical file"" in the  ""afternoon"" context.
            *  This prohibition is also dominated by the permissions granted by ""east hospital"" where he is a ""hospital doctor""  ""prescribing""  in the  ""intern_prescription hour"" context on  ""medical file"", and by the permissions from ""west hospital"".

        *   **Prohibitions 3**: ""west_Hospital"" grants  ""Victor Turner""  as an ""extern""  the prohibition to ""Prescribe"" on  ""personal_data""  in  the ""afternoon""  context. 
           * This prohibition does not directly relate to any of the granted permissions.


    * **Conclusion**: Since all prohibitions are dominated by at least one corresponding permission, Victor Turner's access is granted to perform ""prescription appointment"" on ""patient admin data 3"".

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

        *  Similarly, the ""anesthesic patient"" context for the ""doctor"" permission is preferred to ""sample analysis"".
        * The ""referent_doctor"" context for ""hospital doctor"" permission is also preferred to the ""sample analysis"" context in the prohibition.

    *   These preferences lead to the conclusion that the permission supports dominate the prohibition support, satisfying the decision rule and granting access to Wendy Mitchell.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for James_Wilson to perform list on prescription_1 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1936;349;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support according to the defined preferences. 
2.  **Outcome**: 
The access to perform the ""list"" activity on ""prescription_1"" is granted to James_Wilson. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
*   **Role Preference**:
    *   James_Wilson is employed as an ""intern"" (permission) and a ""patient"" (prohibition), with ""intern"" being preferred to ""patient"". This preference holds across all relevant permissions and prohibitions. 
*    **Context Preference**: 
    *    The ""referent_doctor"" context (permission) is preferred to the ""no_anesthesia"" context (prohibition). This preference applies to all instances where both contexts are involved. 

*   **Other Elements**: 
All other elements, such as the activity (""list""), the object (""prescription_1""), and the organizations (""west_hospital"", ""central_hospital""), are identical in both the permission and prohibition supports. Therefore, they do not contribute to the dominance comparison. 

**Conclusion**: 
Since James_Wilson's role (""intern"") is preferred to his role in the prohibition (""patient""), and the context (""referent_doctor"") is preferred over the prohibition context (""no_ anesthesia""), the permission support completely dominates the prohibition support, leading to the granting of access.

 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2548;381;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for each prohibition support, there exists at least one corresponding permission support where the permission support's elements dominate the prohibition support. Domination means that every element in the permission support must be strictly preferred to, or match, at least one equivalent element in the prohibition support based on the defined preferences. 
2.  **Outcome**: The access to perform the ""transfer"" activity on ""patinet_admin data_2"" in the ""medical_data"" and ""sample"" views is granted to Henry_Lee. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**: The decision is based on the dominance of the permission supports over the prohibition supports. Here's a breakdown: 
    *   **Role Preference**:  
        *   Henry_Lee is employed as an ""anesthetist"" by the ""east_hospital"" and as a ""liberal_doctor"" by ""south_hospital"". These roles are both preferred to the role of ""medical_secretary"" and ""extern"" held by Henry_Lee at ""south hospital"".
    *  **Context Preference**:
        *  The ""anesthesic patient"" context in both ""east hospital"" and ""south hospital"" is preferred to the ""sample_analysis"" and ""afternoon"" contexts. 

    * **Element Matching**: All other elements, such as the activity ""transfer"" being considered equivalent to ""prescribe"" by ""central_hospital"", and the use of ""patinet admin data_2"", are identical in both permission and prohibition supports, thus requiring no preference comparison.


    Since the permission supports consistently dominate the prohibition supports based on role, context, and matching elements, the access is granted according to the decision rule.

4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation east_hospital employes Rachel_Baker in the role surgeon, `` is preferred to ``The organisation east_hospital employes Rachel_Baker in the role medical_secretary, `` because: surgeon is preferred to medical_secretary. 
The relation ``The context referent_doctor holds between Rachel_Baker, list, and patinet_admin_data_1 in the organisation east_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context afternoon holds between Rachel_Baker, list, and patinet_admin_data_1 in the organisation east_hospital, `` because: referent_doctor is preferred to afternoon. 
The relation ``The organisation east_hospital employes Rachel_Baker in the role surgeon, `` is preferred to ``The organisation east_hospital employes Rachel_Baker in the role extern, `` because: surgeon is preferred to extern. 
The relation ``The context referent_doctor holds between Rachel_Baker, list, and patinet_admin_data_1 in the organisation east_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context afternoon holds between Rachel_Baker, list, and patinet_admin_data_1 in the organisation east_hospital, `` because: referent_doctor is preferred to afternoon. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Rachel_Baker to perform list on patinet_admin_data_1 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1740;285;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support according to the defined preferences. 
2.  **Outcome**: 
The access to perform the ""list"" activity on ""patinet_admin data_1"" in the ""sample"" view is granted to Rachel_Baker. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
* **Role Preference**: 
    * The permission support includes ""Rachel_Baker"" in the role ""surgeon"", which is preferred to the roles ""medical_secretary"" and ""extern"" present in the prohibition supports. 
* **Context Preference**:
    *  The permission support specifies the ""referent_doctor"" context, which is preferred over the ""afternoon"" context used in both prohibition supports.
* **Element Matching**: 
   * All other elements (activity ""list"", view ""sample"", and organization ""east_hospital"") are identical in both the permission and prohibition supports, so no preference is needed. 

**Conclusion**: 
Since the permission support's role and context are both preferred to those in the prohibitions, and all other elements match, the access is granted according to the dominance rule.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization north_hospital grants the role anesthetist the Permission to perform the activity validate on the view sample if the context emergency holds,The organisation north_hospital employes Liam_Taylor in the role anesthetist, The organisation central_hospital considers sign as a validate activity, The organisation north_hospital uses patinet_medical_data_1 in the view sample, The context emergency holds between Liam_Taylor, sign, and patinet_medical_data_1 in the organisation north_hospital,  
(support 2): The organization south_hospital grants the role liberal_doctor the Permission to perform the activity validate on the view personal_data if the context referent_doctor holds,The organisation south_hospital employes Liam_Taylor in the role liberal_doctor, The organisation central_hospital considers sign as a validate activity, The organisation south_hospital uses patinet_medical_data_1 in the view personal_data, The context referent_doctor holds between Liam_Taylor, sign, and patinet_medical_data_1 in the organisation south_hospital,  
3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support:

4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation north_hospital employes Liam_Taylor in the role anesthetist, `` is preferred to ``The organisation west_hospital employes Liam_Taylor in the role student, `` because: anesthetist is preferred to student. 
The relation ``The context emergency holds between Liam_Taylor, sign, and patinet_medical_data_1 in the organisation north_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context sample_analysis holds between Liam_Taylor, sign, and patinet_medical_data_1 in the organisation west_hospital, `` because: emergency is preferred to sample_analysis. 
The relation ``The organisation south_hospital employes Liam_Taylor in the role liberal_doctor, `` is preferred to ``The organisation west_hospital employes Liam_Taylor in the role student, `` because: liberal_doctor is preferred to student. 
The relation ``The context referent_doctor holds between Liam_Taylor, sign, and patinet_medical_data_1 in the organisation south_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context sample_analysis holds between Liam_Taylor, sign, and patinet_medical_data_1 in the organisation west_hospital, `` because: referent_doctor is preferred to sample_analysis. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Liam_Taylor to perform sign on patinet_medical_data_1 is granted.

 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1750;356;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of permission support over prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: 
   Access is granted to Liam_Taylor for the activity ""validate"" on the view ""patinet_medical data_1"". 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    * **Role Preference:**
        * The permission supports include roles ""anesthetist"" and ""liberal_doctor"", both preferred to the prohibition role ""student"". 
        * This preference is based on the organization's hierarchy and the associated responsibilities.

    * **Context Preference**:
        * Both permission contexts (""emergency"" and ""referent_doctor"") are preferred over the prohibition context (""sample_analysis"").
        * These preferences reflect the urgency and sensitivity of the tasks associated with each context. 

    * Matching Elements:
        * All permission and prohibition supports share:
            * The organization ""central_hospital"" considers ""sign"" as a ""validate"" activity.
            *  The organization ""north_hospital"", ""south_hospital"", and ""west_hospital"" all use ""patinet medical data_1"" in the respective views.
        * Since these elements are identical, they don't contribute to dominance. 


    * **Dominance:**
        Because the permission supports have preferred roles, contexts, and matching elements, they dominate the prohibition support, satisfying the decision rule and granting access.

### Output:";1717;337;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches an element in the corresponding prohibition support.

2.  **Outcome**: 
   The access to perform the ""cancer_analysis"" activity on ""sample_5"" is granted to Katherine_Moore.

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    * **Role Preference**: The permission support states that Katherine_Moore is employed as a ""liberal_doctor"" by the ""north_hospital"". This role is strictly preferred over the ""patient"" role she holds in the prohibition support from the ""east_hospital"".

    * **Context Preference**:  The permission support specifies the ""emergency"" context, which is strictly preferred compared to the ""no_anesthesia"" context in the first prohibition support.


    * **No Preference Needed**: Both the permission and prohibition supports share the same activity (""cancer_analysis"") and the same data object (""sample_5"") as defined by the ""central_hospital"". Since these elements are identical, they don't require a preference comparison. 

    The second prohibition support, involving the ""morning"" context and the ""medical_data"" view, is irrelevant to the decision as it doesn't involve the same activity or data object as the granted permission. 



Therefore, because the permission support dominates the relevant prohibition support based on role and context preferences, access is allowed.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2384;329;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support where the permission’s support dominantes the prohibition’s support.  Dominance occurs when each element in the permission support strictly prefers at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access to perform the ""read_db"" activity on the ""prescription_1"" view is granted to Bob_Smith. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    *   **Role Preference**: The permission supports grant Bob_Smith roles like ""intern"", ""surgeon"", ""anesthetist"" within the ""west_hospital"", while the prohibition support assigns him the role of ""student"" in the ""east_hospital"". Intern, surgeon, and anesthetist roles are all preferred to the ""student"" role. 
    *  **Context Preference**:  The permission supports utilize contexts like ""referent_doctor"" and ""emergency"" within the  ""west_hospital"". The prohibition support uses the context ""morning"" within the “east_hospital”.  ""Referent_doctor""  and ""emergency"" contexts are both preferred over the ""morning"" context.
    * **Element Matching**: Both the permission and prohibition supports share elements like Bob_Smith's employment, the activity ""consult"", and the use of ""prescription_""1"" in the view. These shared elements don't require preference comparisons. 

Since the permission supports dominate the prohibition supports in both role and context preferences, the access is granted according to the decision rule.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports:

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1981;385;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if every element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support according to the defined preferences. 
2.  **Outcome**:  
    The access to perform ""prescribe_medecine"" on ""sample_5"" is granted to James_Wilson. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    *   **Role Preference:**
        *   James_Wilson is employed as a ""specialist"" in the ""east_hospital,"" which is preferred over his role as a ""medical_secretary"" in both the ""south_hospital"" and the ""east hospital"" (prohibitions). 
    *  **Context Preference:**
       *   The ""referent_doctor"" context in the east_hospital is preferred over the ""morning"" context (prohibition) and the ""sample_analysis"" context (multiple prohibitions).

    * **Dominance Analysis:**
        Let's analyze how the permission support dominates the prohibitions:

        *   **Prohibition 1 (east_hospital, morning):** The permission's role (""specialist"") and context (""referent_doctor"") are both strictly preferred to those in the prohibition. Therefore, the permission dominates this prohibition.

        * **Prohibition 2 & 3 (south_hospital, sample_analysis):**  Similar to Prohibition 1, the permission support's role and context are strictly preferred, leading to dominance.



    Conclusion: Since the permission support consistently dominates all prohibition supports based on role and context preferences, James_Wilson's access is granted for the specified activity and context.

### Output:";2229;356;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support where the permission’s support strictly dominates the prohibition’s support.  Dominance means each element in the permission support is preferred over at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access is granted to Rachel_Baker. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    *   **Role Preference:**
        *   The permission involves Rachel_Baker as a ""hospital_doctor,"" which is preferred over the roles ""patient"" (in prohibition 1), ""medical_secretary"" (in prohibitions 2 & 4), and ""extern"" (in prohbition 3).
    *  **Context Preference:**
       *   The context ""intern_presc\_hour"" (in the permission) is preferred over ""afternoon"" (prohibitions 1 & 2) and ""no_anesthesia"" (prohibition 3 & 4). 

    * **Element Matching:** Some elements are identical in both the permission and prohibitions (e.g., ""handle_db,"" ""sample_1,"" and the organization ""central_hospital""). Since these are the same, they don't contribute to dominance.

    **Explanation:**

    The decision is based on the dominance of the permission support over each prohibition support. Rachel_Baker's role (""hospital_doctor"") is preferred over all the roles assigned in the prohibitions. Additionally, the context ""intern\_presc\_ hour"" is preferred over contexts in the prohibitions, further strengthening the dominance.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";3076;334;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support where the permission support dominates the prohibitions support. Domination means each element in the permission support is strictly preferable to atleast one element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access is granted for Eva Clark to perform ""aOperate"" on ""patinet_admin data_1"". 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    *   **Role Preference**:
        *   Eva Clark is employed as a ""doctor"" by the ""south_hospital"", which is preferred to being a ""medical_secretary"" employed by the ""east_hospital"". This preference applies to both the ""medical_file"" and ""prescribtion data"" views.
        
    *  **Context Preference**:
       *   The ""emergency"" context is preferred to the ""sample_analysis"" context. This preference applies when considering access to both ""medical_files"" and ""prescription_data"". 
       *  The ""referent_doctor"" context is also preferred over the ""sample analysis"" context. 

    *   These preferences lead to the conclusion that the permissions granted to Eva Clark through her role as ""doctor"" and ""hospital_doctor"" in the ""south hospital"" under the ""emergency"" and ""referent doctor"" contexts dominate the prohibitions imposed on her as a ""medical secretary"" in the  ""east_hospital"" under the  ""sample analysis""  context.

        * James Wilson is employed as a ""doctor"" in the East Hospital, which is preferred to roles like ""extern"" (North Hospital), ""student"" (North & East Hospitals), and ""medical_secretary"" (East Hospital). 
        * Similarly, James Wilson's role as a ""surgeon"" in East Hospital is preferred to ""extern"", ""student"", and ""medical secretary"".

    * **Context Preferences**:
       * The contexts ""intern_presc hour"" and ""emergency"" are preferred to contexts like ""morning"", ""no_anesthesia"", and ""sample_analysis"".


    * **Matching Elements**: Some elements in both permission and prohibition supports are identical (e.g., ""James Wilson"", ""aOperate"", ""patinet medical data_5""). These don't contribute to dominance but are still considered part of the overall comparison. 

   * **Granting the Access**:  Because James Wilson holds preferred roles (""doctor"" and ""surgeon"") and operates under preferred contexts (""intern_prescription_hour"" & ""emergency""), his permissions dominate the prohibitions. This satisfies the decision rule, leading to the granting of access.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2163;431;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates it. Dominance is achieved when each element in the permission support is preferred to, or matches, at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

2.  **Outcome**: The access to perform ""prepare_operation"" (specifically ""anaesthetize"") on ""patinet_medical data_1"" is granted to Amelia_King. 

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:

    *   **Permission 1 (East Hospital):** 
        *   Amelia_King is employed as an ""anesthetist"" in the East Hospital. (Preferred over ""patient"" in the South Hospital prohibition)
        *    The context ""anesthesic patient"" holds, which is preferred over ""sample_analysis"" in South Hospital's prohibition.

    *  **Permission 2 (South Hospital):**
        *  Amelia_King works as an ""intern"" at South Hospital, preferred over ""patient"".
        * The context ""emergency"" is present, favored over ""sample analysis"".

    * **Prohibitions:**
        * **South Hospital:** Amelia_King as a ""patient"" with ""sample analysis"" context. This is dominated by both permission 1 and permission 2 due to preferred roles (""anesthetist"", ""intern"") and contexts (""anesthetic patient"", ""emergency""). 

        * **East Hospital:**  Amelia King as a ""medical secretary"" with ""afternoon"" context.  This is dominated by permission 1 due to the preferred role (""anesthestist"") and context (""anesthestic patient""). 



    * **Matching Elements:** Both permissions and prohibitions share:
        * Amelia_King's employment
        * Central Hospital's definition of ""prepare_ operation"" as ""anaesthetise""
        * Use of ""patinet medical data_1"". 

    These shared elements contribute to the overall dominance of the permission supports over the prohibition supports, leading to the granting of access.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Rachel_Baker to perform delegate on prescription_1 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2818;427;"1.  **Decision Rule**: Access is granted if for each support prohibiting an action, there is a corresponding support permitting the same action where the permission support dominates the prohibitions support. Domination means that every element in the permission support is strictly better than at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support.

2.  **Outcome**: The access is granted, meaning Rachel_Baker is permitted to perform the ""handle"" activity on the specified views (""personal_data"", ""admin_data"", and ""sample"").

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:

    *   **Role Preferences**:
        *   The roles ""doctor"", ""nurse"", and ""anesthetist"" are all preferred to the role ""patient"" and ""medical_secretary"". This means permissions granted to these roles are more likely to be granted than those granted to the less preferred roles.

    *  **Context Preferences**:
       *   ""emergency"" is preferred over ""sample_analysis"" and ""morning"". This implies that actions taken in emergency situations are considered more important and have higher priority.
       *  ""anesthesic patient"" is preferred to ""morning"".

    * **Dominance Analysis**:
        Let's analyze how the permissions dominate the prohibitions:

        *   **Prohibition 1**: ""north_hospital"" grants ""patient"" the prohibition to ""handle"" on ""medical_file"" in the context of ""sample analysis"".
            *   This prohibition is dominated by the permission granted to Rachel_Baker as a ""doctor"" at ""south_hospital"" in the ""emergency"" context for handling ""personal_data"". Both the role (""doctor"" > ""patient"") and the context (""emergency"" > ""sample analysis"") are preferred.

        *  **Prohibitions 2 & 3**: These prohibitions are related to ""morning"" context and are dominated by the permissions granted in ""emergency"" contexts.


Therefore, based on the dominance of the permission supports over the prohibition supports, Rachel_Baker's access is granted for the specified actions and views.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1707;421;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or identical to a corresponding element in the prohibition support according to the defined preferences. 
2.  **Outcome**: 
The access to perform the ""analyze"" activity on ""prescription_1"" is granted to Henry_Lee. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:  
The decision is based on the comparison of two permission supports and one prohibition support. 

* **Permission Support 1 (north_hospital):**
    * **Role Assignment:** The organization *north_hospital* employs Henry_Lee as an *intern*. This is preferred to the prohibition support's role (*extern*) because *intern* is preferred to *extern*. 
    *  **Context:** The context *anesthesic patient* holds between Henry Lee, ""biopsy"", and ""prescription 1"" in the *north hospital*. This context is preferred over the prohibition context (*sample_analysis*) due to the preference hierarchy.
    * Other elements (identical): Both supports share the organization (*north_hospital*), the activity (*analyze*), and the object (*prescription_1*). These elements are considered identical and don't contribute to dominance.

*  **Permission Support 2 (south_hospital)**:
    * Similar to the first permission support, this one also has a preferred role (*intern*) and context (*referent_doctor*) compared to the prohibition.

* **Prohibition Support:**
    * The organization *south_hospital* grants Henry_Lee (*extern*) the prohibition to perform *analyze* on *prescription_data* in the context of *sample_analysis*.


Since both permission supports dominate the prohibition support based on the preferred role and context, the access is granted according to the decision rule.

4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation west_hospital employes James_Wilson in the role surgeon, `` is preferred to ``The organisation north_hospital employes James_Wilson in the role patient, `` because: surgeon is preferred to patient. 
The relation ``The context referent_doctor holds between James_Wilson, list, and prescription_2 in the organisation west_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context sample_analysis holds between James_Wilson, list, and prescription_2 in the organisation north_hospital, `` because: referent_doctor is preferred to sample_analysis. 
The relation ``The organisation west_hospital employes James_Wilson in the role surgeon, `` is preferred to ``The organisation south_hospital employes James_Wilson in the role extern, `` because: surgeon is preferred to extern. 
The relation ``The context referent_doctor holds between James_Wilson, list, and prescription_2 in the organisation west_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context no_anesthesia holds between James_Wilson, list, and prescription_2 in the organisation south_hospital, `` because: referent_doctor is preferred to no_anesthesia. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for James_Wilson to perform list on prescription_2 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1697;412;"1.  **Decision Rule**: 
    Access is granted based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support.  
    A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches a corresponding element in the prohibition support according to the defined preferences. 
2.  **Outcome**:  
    The access is GRANTED. James_Wilson is permitted to perform the ""list"" activity on ""prescription_2"" in the ""medical_data"" view. 
3.  **Relations & Preferences**:
    * **Role Preference:**
        * The permission support states: ""The organization *west_hospital* employs *James_Wilson* in the role *surgeon*."" 
        * This is preferred over:
            * The prohibition support from *north_hospital*:  ""The organization *north_hospita*l employs James_Wilson"" in the role *""patient*.""
        * It's also preferred over the prohibition from *south_hospital*: ""The organisation *south_hosptal* employs *james_wilson*  in the role *extern*.""
    *  **Context Preference:**
       * The permission context: ""The context *referent_doctor* holds between *James_wilson*, *list*, and *prescription_2* in the organization *west hospital*.""
       * Is preferred over: 
           * The prohibition context from *north hospital*: ""The context  *sample_analysis* holds...""
       * And preferred over the context from *south hospital*: "" The context *no_anesthesia* holds...""

    * **Dominance:** Because the role (""surgeon"") and context (""referent_doctor"") in the permission are preferred over the corresponding elements in both prohibitions, the permission support dominates both prohibition supports. This fulfills the decision rule, granting access.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

2.  **Outcome**: The access to perform the ""sign"" activity on ""sample_5"" in the ""personal_data"" view is granted to Victor_Turner.

3.  **Relations & Preferences**:

    * **Permission Support:**
        * **Role Assignment:** Victor_Turner is employed as a ""liberal_doctor"" by the ""west_hospital"". This role is preferred over the roles assigned in the prohibition supports (""extern"", ""medical_secretary"").
        *  **Context:** The context ""referent_doctor"" holds between Victor Turner, ""sign"" (the activity), and  ""sample_5"". This context is preferred over contexts like ""morning"" and ""afternoon"" used in the prohibitions.

    *  **Prohibition Supports:**
        Several prohibitions exist, but they are all dominated by the permission support:
            * **Prohibition 1:**  Victor_Turner as ""extern"" at ""south_hospital"" with ""morning"" context for ""validate"" on ""medical_data"". 
            *  **(Prohibition 2-4):** Similar to Prohibition 1, but with different views (""prescribtion data"", ""medical file"", ""admin data"") and contexts (""morning"", ""afternoon"").

    *   **Dominance:** The permission's role (""liberal_doctor"") and context (""referent_doctor"") are both strictly preferred to the roles and contexts used in any of the prohibition supports. Therefore, the permission dominates all prohibitions.
