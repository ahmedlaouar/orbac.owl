### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1397;847;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule:** Access is granted by the overall logic if and only for every support for a prohibition there exists a support for the corresponding permission where the support for the permission dominates the support for prohibition. A support dominates another support if every element in the support for permission is preferred to an element in the corresponding support for the prohibition. 
**Outcome:** The access is allowed because the permission support is preferred to the prohibition support. 
**Relations and Preferences:** 
Permission support elements: 
Role assignment: The organization university1 employs Ursula Carter in the role of researcher. → Preferred to the prohibition’s role assignment: the organization institute2 employs Ursula_carter in the post_doc role. 
Reason: The role of researcher is preferred over the role of post doc. 
Context: The context audit hold between Ursula Carter, read and report 7 in the organization university1.→ Preferred to the context of the prohibition: the context of default hold between Ursa_carter, read and reports 7 in organization institute 2. 
Reasons: The context of audit is preferred over context of default. 
Other elements (no preference needed): 
Both permission and prohibition shares: 
The organization university1 considers read as consult activity. 
The organization institute2 considers read as conslult activity. 
Since these are the same, no preference comparisons are needed. 
Conclusion: Since all the elements in the permission support are preferred to the elements of the prohibition support, the access is allowed.

### Output:
Explanation of the decision:

**Decision Rule:**
Access is not granted by overall logic. 
**Outcomes:**
The access is denied because the permission’s support is not preferred over the prohibition’s support.
**Relations and preferences:**
Permission support elements:
Role assignment: Organization university1 employs Ursa_Carther in role researcher. → Not preferred to prohibition’s role assigment: organization institute2 employes Ursa_Cartner in role post_doc.
Reason: researcher is not preferred to post_doctor.
Context: Context of audit holds between ursa_carter and read and report_7 in organization university 1.→ Not preferred to context of prohibition: context of default holds between urosa_carter,read and report_8 in organization institute2.
Reason: audit is not prefered to default.
Other elements(no preference needed):
Both permissions and prohibitions share:
The organization university_1 consider read as consult activities.
The organization institute_2 consider read as a conslult activities.
Since these are identical,no preference comparison is needed.
Conclusion: Since the elements of permission support are not preferred to elements of prohibition support,the access is denied.

### Output:";2618;285;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when, for every prohibition, there is a corresponding permission with a support that dominates the prohibition. A support dominates a prohibition if each element of its support is strictly more preferred than at least one of the elements of its prohibition. 
**Outcome**: 
The access is granted since the permission's supports dominate the prohibition's supports. 
**Relations and Preferences:** 
Permission Support Elements:
Role Assignment: The Organisation University2 employs Olivia Scott in the role Team Leader. → Preferred Over the Prohibition's Role Assignment: Olivia Scott is employed in the role Staff Member by the Organisation Institute2. 
Reason: Team Leader is preferred to Staff Member. 
Context: The Context Management holds between Olivia Scott, Sign, and Dataset2 in the Organisation University2. → Preferred to the Prohibition’s Context: The Context Collaboration holds between Olivia scott, Sign, And Dataset2 In The Organisation Institute2.
Reason: Management is preferred to Collaboration. 
Other Elements (No preference needed): 
Both Permission and Prohibition share: 
The Organisation Consortium considers Sign as a Validate Activity. 
The Organisation University2 uses Dataset 2 in the View Data. 
Since These Are Identical, No Preference Comparison Is Required.

        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports:

        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2010;465;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule:** Access is granted by the decision rule if and only   if, for any support of a Prohibition, there exists at least one support of a Permission where the Permission's Support dominates the Prohibition's Support. Dominance is defined as follows: For each element of a Permission's Support, there must exist at least one other element of the Permission's support that is strictly preferred over the corresponding element of the Prohibitions' Support. 
**Outcome:** The outcome is that access is granted.
**Relations and Preferences:**
**Permission Support Elements:**
**Prohibition Support Elements:**

**Both dominance conditions (Role Preference and Context Preference) are met.**
**Permission's Support Contains Elements that are Strictly Preferred to Corresponding Elements in the Prohibiton's Support.**
**Specifically:**
**Role Preference:**
**The role assignment of the permission: The organization University 1 employs Paul_Harris  in the role Full_Professor.**
**Preferred over the Prohibtion's Role Assignment:  The organization Institute 1 employs  Paul_Harris   in the role Secondee.**
**Reason: Full_professor  is preferred to  secondee.
**Context Preference:**
The context of the Permission: The context audit  holds  between  Paul_harris,  copy,  and  dataset6  in  the  organization  University 1.
**Preferred  over  the  Prohibition's  Context:  The  context  default  holds   between   Paul_harris,  copy,  and  Dataset6  in the organization University 3.
**Reason:  audit  is  preferred  to  default.
**Other Elements (no preference needed):**
**Both Permission and Prohibition share:**
The organization Consortium considers copy  as  a  modify  activity.
The organization University  1  uses  dataset  6  in   the  view  WP  4.
Since these are identical  no  preference  comparison  is  required.
**Conclusion:** Since all elements  of  the  Permission's  Support  are  either  preferred  or  match  the  prohibition's  Support,  access  is  granted.

### Output:";1408;213;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when, for every prohibition, there is a corresponding permission with a support that dominates the prohibition’s support. 
**Outcome**: 
The access is granted since the permission’s support is dominant to the prohibition’s. 
**Relations and Preferences:** 
Permission support elements: 
Role assignment: The organization university3 employs Amelia King in the role Full_Professor. 
Reason: Full_Professional is preferred to Associate_Professional. 
Context: The context holds between Amelia King, Describe, and Agreement6 in the organization university3. 
Reasons: Secondment is preferred over default. 
Other elements (no preference needed): 
Both permission and prohibition shares: 
The organization university3 considers Describe as a Consult activity. 
The organization University3 uses Agreement6 in view WP4. 
Since these are identical no preference comparison was required. 
Conclusion: Since all the elements of the permissions support are preferred to or equal to the prohibition support, the access is granted.

### **Input:1. Overall Logic:** Explan the condition under whic access is granted or denied. An access       is granted if it is not prohibited. A prohibition is granted if the permission is not granted. A permission is granted if its support is not dominated by the support of any prohibition. A support is dominated by another support if the elements of the support are strictly preferred by the elements of another support. Strict preference means that at least one of the elements of one support is preferred to the corresponding element of the other support.

An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";3561;598;"1. Overall Logic: 
An access is granted when the following condition is met: for every support for a prohibition there exists a support for the corresponding permission where the support for the permission is preferred to the support for its corresponding prohibition. 
2. Supports of Permission: 
The organization Institute3 has granted the role coordinator to Eva_Clark the permission to perform the action create on the dataset1. 
3. Supports of Prohibition:
The organization University1 has granted the roles associate_professor and post_doc to Eve_Clark the prohibition to perform the actions create on the datasets1 and WP2. 
4. Preferences Between the Elements:
The relation ``Eva_Clark is an employee of the organization Institute3,`` is preferred over the relation ``Eve_Clark is a student of the organization University1,`` because: an employee is preferred to a student. The relation ``create is a modify action,`` is more preferred than ``create is not a modify action`` because: a modify action is more preferred to a non-modify action. 
5. The Decision: 
The access was granted because the supports for the permission and the prohibition are both preferred to each other. 
6. Relations and Preferences: 
The permission support contains elements which are preferred to the corresponding elements of the prohibition support. 
7. Decision Rule: 
Access is granted when for every support to a prohibition there is a corresponding support to a permission such that the support to the permission is prefered to the support to its corresponding prohibition.
8. Outcome: 
Access was granted because both the permission support and the prohibition support contain elements which are prefered to their corresponding elements. 
9. Relation and Preference: 
Permission Support Elements:
Role Assignment: The organization Institute emploies Eve_Clark as a coordinator. 
Reason: Coordinator is preferred to Post_Doc. 
Context: The context Audit holds between Eve_Clark, Create, and Dataset1 in the organization Institute.
Reason: Audit is preferred to Default. 
Other Elements (no preference needed): 
Both permission and prohibition shares: 
Create is a Modify Action. 
Dataset1 is used in the view Internal_Data. 
Since these are identical no preference comparisons are required. 
Prohibition Support Elements:
Prohibition: Associate_Professor and Post_Doc are prohibited from performing the action Create on the Dataset1 and the View WP2.
Reason: Post_Doc is preferred to Coordinator. 
Context : The context Default holds between Eve_Clark, Create and Dataset1.
Reason: Default is preferred to Collaboration. 
Other elements (No Preference needed): 
Associate_Professor is prohibited from performing Create on the WP2.
Post_Doc is prohibited from peforming Create on the Datasets1.
Since these are the same no preference comparisons need to be made. 
Conclusion: Since all the elements of the permissions support are either prefered to or match with the prohibition support, access was granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share:

        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

**Decision Rule:** Access is granted by the decision rule if and only   if, for any support of a Prohibition, there exists another support of a Permission where the Permission's Support dominates the Prohibition's Support. Dominance here means that each Element of the Permission's support is Strictly Preferred to at least One Element of the Prohibition' s support. 
**Outcome:** The outcome is that the access is granted, because the Permission' s support dominates the Prohibitions' support. Specifically, 
The Permission' s Support contains Elements that are strictly Preferred to Corresponding Elements in the Prohibition's Support. 
Both Dominance Conditions (Role Preference and Context Preference) are Satisfied. 
**Relations and Preferences:**

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";2239;226;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule:** Access is granted by the decision rule ""if and only if"". 
**Outcome:** The permission for Ben_foster to perform'sign' on'report5' is granted.
**Relations and Preferences:**
Permission Support Elements:
Role Assignment: The organization university1 employs Ben_foster in the full_professor role. 
Reason: Full_professor is more preferred than secondee.
Context: The context'secondment' holds between Ben_foster,'sign', and'report5', in the organization university1.
Reason: Secondment is more prefered than 'default'.
Other Elements (no preference needed):
The organization university1 considers'sign' as a 'validate' activity.
The organization university3 uses'report1' in the view 'WP2'.
The organization university2 uses'report5'in the view 'public_data'.
Since these elements are identical, they do not need to be compared.
Conclusion: Since all the elements in the permission support are either prefered to or match those in the prohibition support, the access is granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Input:1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if,         for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.         Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization University2 grants the role team_leader the Permission to perform the activity validate on the view WP5 if the context audit holds,The organisation University2 employes Eva_Clark in the role team_leader, The organisation Consortium considers sign as a validate activity, The organisation University2 uses dataset1 in the view WP5, The context audit holds between Eva_Clark, sign, and dataset1 in the organisation University2,  
(support 2): The organization Institute1 grants the role coordinator the Permission to perform the activity validate on the view WP1 if the context secondment holds,The organisation Institute1 employes Eva_Clark in the role coordinator, The organisation Consortium considers sign as a validate activity, The organisation Institute1 uses dataset1 in the view WP1, The context secondment holds between Eva_Clark, sign, and dataset1 in the organisation Institute1,  
3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
(support 1): The organization Institute1 grants the role associate_professor the Prohibition to perform the activity validate on the view confidential_data if the context default holds,The organisation Institute1 employes Eva_Clark in the role associate_professor, The organisation Consortium considers sign as a validate activity, The organisation Institute1 uses dataset1 in the view confidential_data, The context default holds between Eva_Clark, sign, and dataset1 in the organisation Institute1,  
4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation University2 employes Eva_Clark in the role team_leader, `` is preferred to ``The organisation Institute1 employes Eva_Clark in the role associate_professor, `` because: team_leader is preferred to associate_professor. 
The relation ``The context audit holds between Eva_Clark, sign, and dataset1 in the organisation University2, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Eva_Clark, sign, and dataset1 in the organisation Institute1, `` because: audit is preferred to default. 
The relation ``The organisation Institute1 employes Eva_Clark in the role coordinator, `` is preferred to ``The organisation Institute1 employes Eva_Clark in the role associate_professor, `` because: coordinator is preferred to associate_professor. 
The relation ``The context secondment holds between Eva_Clark, sign, and dataset1 in the organisation Institute1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Eva_Clark, sign, and dataset1 in the organisation Institute1, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Eva_Clark to perform sign on dataset1 is granted.

### Output:";1599;395;"**Decision Rule:** Access is granted when the following conditions are met: 
1. The permission's supports are preferred to the prohibition's supports. 
2. For each element of a permission's support, there exists an element of a prohibition's support that is preferred to it. 
**Outcome:** The access was granted. 
**Relations and Preferences:** 
The permission's supports contain elements that are preferred to elements in the prohibitions' supports. 
Both dominance conditions (permission's role preference and prohibition's role preference) are met. 
**Permission Support Elements:** 
1. Role Assignment: Eva_Clark is a team_leader in the organization University2. → Preferred to the prohibition’s role assignment: Associate_Professor in the organization Institute1. 
Reason: team_leader > associate_professor 
2. Context: The audit context holds between Eva_Clark and sign in the University2.→ Preferred to the default context in the Institute1.  
Reason: audit > default 
3. Other Elements (no preference needed): 
The organization University2 employs Eva_Clark as a team_leader. 
The organization Institute1 employs her as an associate_professor.
Since these are identical roles, no preference comparisons are required. 
**Prohibition Support Elements**
1. Role assignment: Associate_professor in the institute1. → Not preferred to the permission's role assignment. 
Reason : associate_professor is not preferred to team_leader.  
2. Context : The default context in institute1.→ Not preferred to audit context in University2.  
Reason : default > audit.  
3. Other elements (No preference needed) : 
The organization institute1 employs Eva_clark as an associate professor. 
The University2 employs her as a team leader. 
Since these are the same roles, no preferences are needed. 
**Conclusion:** Since all elements in the permission support are preferred to or equal to the prohibition support, the access is granted.

### Output:";1596;306;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted if for every support for a prohibition there exists a support for the corresponding permission where the support for the permission dominates the support for prohibition. A support is a list of elements that make up a permission or a prohibition. Dominance is a relation between two supports such that each element in the permission support is preferred over at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support. 
**Outcome**: 
The access is granted since the permission's supports dominate the prohibition's supports. 
**Relations and Preferences**:
Permission Support Elements:
Role Assignment: The organization university1 employs Mia_Andersonin the role coordinator. → Preferredover the prohibition'srole assignment: The organization institute2emploes Mia_andersoninthe role staff_member.
Reason: coordinatorispreferred to staff_member.
Context: The contextsecondmentholds between Mia_anderson, sign,and dataset8in the organization university1.→ Preferredover theprohibition'scontext: The contextcollaborationholds betweenMia_anderson,sign,anddataset8inthe organization institute2.
Reason: secondmentispreferred to collaboration.
Other Elements (NoPreferenceNeeded): 
Both permission and prohibitionshare: 
The organization consortiumconsiders signas a modify activity.
The organization consortiumuses dataset8inthe viewsecondment_agreement.
Since these are identical,no preference comparisonis required.
Conclusion: Since allelements of thepermission's supportare eitherpreferred to ormatch the prohibition'ssupport,access is granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Input:1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if,         for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.         Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization Institute3 grants the role researcher the Permission to perform the activity consult on the view public_data if the context audit holds,The organisation Institute3 employes Chloe_Walker in the role researcher, The organisation Consortium considers select as a consult activity, The organisation Institute3 uses report7 in the view public_data, The context audit holds between Chloe_Walker, select, and report7 in the organisation Institute3,  
3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support:

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1590;1238;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted if, for any support of a Prohibition, there exists another support of a Permission where the Permission's support strictly dominates the Prohibition's support. Strict dominance means that: for each element in the Permission's Support, there exists an element in the Prohibitions' Support that is strictly preferred. 
**Outcome**: 
The access is granted, because the Permission's strict dominance over the Prohibition strictly dominates the other Prohibition's strict dominance. 
**Relations and Preferences**:
Permission Support Elements:
Role Assignment: The organization Institute1 employs Chloe_Walker_in the role researcher. 
Reason: researcher is more preferred than post_doc.
Context: The context audit_holds_between Chloe_Walker,_select,_and_report7_in_the_organization_Institute1.
Reason: audit is more preferred to collaboration.
Other Elements (no preference needed): 
Both permission and prohibition shares: 
The organization Institute1 considers select_as_a_consult_activity.
The organization Institute_1 uses report7_in_the_view_public_data.
Since these elements are identical, they do not need to be compared. 
Conclusion: Since all the elements of the Permission's Strict Dominance are either preferred or identical to the elements of another Prohibition's Strict Domination, the access is granted.
### Input: 
1. **Overal Logic:** 
An access is granted when, for every element of a permission's support, there is a corresponding element of a prohibition's support where the prohibition's element strictly dominates the permission's element. Strict domination means that the permission's elements are strictly preferred by the prohibition's elements. 
2. **SUPPORTS OF PERMISSION:** 
List of elements that compose a permission's supports: 
Support 1: The organization University1 grants the role student the permission to perform the actvity read on the view grades if the context exam_holds,The organization University1 employes Alice in the role student, The organization University2 considers read as a read activity, The organization Univeristy1 uses report5 in the view grades, The context exam holds between Alice, read, and report5in the organization University1, 
3. **SUPPOrts OF PROHIBITION:** List of elements composing a prohibition's supports:
Support 1:The organization University2 grants the roe student the prohibition to peform the activity read_on_the_view_grades_if_the_context_exam_holds, The organisation University2 employes Alice_in_the_role_student, The organisation Univeristy2_considers_read_as_a_read_activity, The organisation univeristy2 uses report5_in_the_view_grade, The context_exam_holds_between_Alice,_read,_and_report5_in_the_organization_univeristy2, 
Support 2: The organization university2 grants the rolle student the prohibition_to_perform_the_activity_read_on_the_view_grade_if_the_context_exams_holds,the_organisation_univeristy_2_employes_Alice_in_the_role_studen,the_organisation_Univeristy2_considers_read_as_a_rea_d_activity,the_organisation_UNIVERISITY2_USES_REPORT5_IN_THE_VIEW_GRADE,the_context_exam_helds_between_Alice,read,and_report5_in_THE_ORGANISATION_UNIVERISTY2, 
4. **PREFERENCES BETWEEN THE ELEMENTS:** 
The relationship ``The organisation University1 employs Alice_in_the_Role_student,`` is preferred to the relationship ``The organization University2 employs Alice in the Role student,`` because: student is preferred to student. 
The relationship ```The context exam holds betweeen Alice,read,and report5in_the_organization_university1,``` is preferred to ```The context exams holds betweneen Alice, read,and report5 in_the_organization_universiry2,``` because: exam is preferred to exams. 
**THE DECISION:** 
The outcome of the logic inference is: The permission for Alice to perform read on report5 is granted.

### Output:
Here is an Explanation of the Decision:
**DECISION RULE**:
Access is granted when for every element in a permission's strict dominance, there is another element in a prohibition's strict dominance that is strictly dominated. Strict Domination means that for each element of a Permission's Support there is an element in a Prohibition's Support that is Strictly Preferred. 
**OUTCOME**:
The Access is Granted, Because the Permission Strict Dominance Over the Prohibition Strict Dominance Strictly Dominates the other Prohibitions Strict Dominance. 
**RELATIONS AND PREFFERENCES**:
PERMISSION SUPPORT ELEMENTS:
ROLE ASSIGNMENT: The organisation University1 EMPLOYS Alice_in_the_ROLE_student. 
REASON: student is more preferred Than student. 
CONTEXT: The context exam_helds_BETWEEN_Alice,_READ,_AND_REPORT5_in_the_organisation_university1.
REASON: exam is more preferred To Exams. 
OTHER ELEMENTS (NO PREFERENCE NEEDED): 
BOTH PERMISSION AND PROHIBITON SHARE: 
The organisation university2 considers read As a read Activity. 
The organisation univerisity2 uses report 5 in the View grades. 
Since these elements Are Identical, They Do Not Need To Be Compared. 
CONCLUSION: Since All The Elements Of The Permission's Strict Domnination Are Either Preferred Or Identical To The Elements Of Another Prohibition'S Strict Dominance, The Access Is Granted.

### Input:1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if,         for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.         Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization Institute1 grants the role coordinator the Permission to perform the activity validate on the view reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation Institute1 employes Tina_Allen in the role coordinator, The organisation Consortium considers sign as a validate activity, The organisation Institute1 uses dataset7 in the view reports, The context secondment holds between Tina_Allen, sign, and dataset7 in the organisation Institute1,  
(support 2): The organization Institute1 grants the role coordinator the Permission to perform the activity validate on the view WP1 if the context secondment holds,The organisation Institute1 employes Tina_Allen in the role coordinator, The organisation Consortium considers sign as a validate activity, The organisation Institute1 uses dataset7 in the view WP1, The context secondment holds between Tina_Allen, sign, and dataset7 in the organisation Institute1,  
(support 3): The organization University2 grants the role full_professor the Permission to perform the activity validate on the view internal_data if the context audit holds,The organisation University2 employes Tina_Allen in the role full_professor, The organisation Consortium considers sign as a validate activity, The organisation University2 uses dataset7 in the view internal_data, The context audit holds between Tina_Allen, sign, and dataset7 in the organisation University2,  
3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
(support 1): The organization University1 grants the role post_doc the Prohibition to perform the activity validate on the view reports if the context default holds,The organisation University1 employes Tina_Allen in the role post_doc, The organisation Consortium considers sign as a validate activity, The organisation University1 uses dataset7 in the view reports, The context default holds between Tina_Allen, sign, and dataset7 in the organisation University1,  
4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation Institute1 employes Tina_Allen in the role coordinator, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University1 employes Tina_Allen in the role post_doc, `` because: coordinator is preferred to post_doc. 
The relation ``The context secondment holds between Tina_Allen, sign, and dataset7 in the organisation Institute1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Tina_Allen, sign, and dataset7 in the organisation University1, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
The relation ``The organisation Institute1 employes Tina_Allen in the role coordinator, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University1 employes Tina_Allen in the role post_doc, `` because: coordinator is preferred to post_doc. 
The relation ``The context secondment holds between Tina_Allen, sign, and dataset7 in the organisation Institute1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Tina_Allen, sign, and dataset7 in the organisation University1, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
The relation ``The organisation University2 employes Tina_Allen in the role full_professor, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University1 employes Tina_Allen in the role post_doc, `` because: full_professor is preferred to post_doc. 
The relation ``The context audit holds between Tina_Allen, sign, and dataset7 in the organisation University2, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Tina_Allen, sign, and dataset7 in the organisation University1, `` because: audit is preferred to default. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Tina_Allen to perform sign on dataset7 is granted.

### Output:";1792;611;"Here is an explanation of the decision making process:
**Decision Rule:** Access is granted by the decision rule if and only for every support for a prohibition there exists a support for the corresponding permission where the support for the permission dominates the support for prohibition. 
**Outcome:** The permission for Tina Allens to perform the sign activity on dataset 7 is granted.
**Relations and Preferences:**
Permission Support Elements:
Role Assignment: The organization University 2 employs Tina Allen in the role Full Professor. → Preferred Over the prohibition's Role Assignment: the organization University 1 employs Tina Allens in the role Post Doc.
Reason: Full Professor is preferred to Post Doc.
Context: The context Audit holds between Tina Allens, sign and dataset 7 in the Organization University 2.→ Preferred Over the Prohibition's Context: The Context Default holds between Tina Allen, sign and Dataset 7 in The Organization University 1.
Reason: Audit is preferred to Default.
Other Elements (No preference needed):
Both Permission and Prohibition share:
The Organization Consortium considers Sign as a Validate Activity.
The Organization University 3 uses Dataset 7 In the View Reports.
Since these are identical no preference comparison needs to be made.
Conclusion: Since all Elements of the Permission's Support are either Preferred to or Match the prohibition's Support, Access is Granted.

Using the provided logic and supports, please explain the reasoning behind the decision. Please use the following structure:
1. **Logic:** [Provide the logic used to make the decision.]
2. **Outcomes:** [Describe the outcome of the decision-making.]
3. **Reasoning:** [Explain why the decision was made.]
Make sure to follow the structure exactly and include all relevant information.

### Output:
Here is the explanation of the reasoning:
**Logic:** Access is Granted by the Decision Rule if and Only for Every Support for a Prohibition There Exists a Support for the Corresponding Permission Where the Support for the Permission Dominates the Support for Prohibition.
**Outcomes:** The Permission for Tina Allans to Perform the Sign Activity on Dataset 7 is Granted.
**Reasoning:** The Permission's Support Contains Elements that are Strictly Preferred to Corresponding Elements in the Prohibition’s Support.
Both Dominance Conditions (Role Preference and Context Preference) are Satisfied.
The Relation ""The Organization University2 Employes Tina Allen in The Role Full Professor"" is Preferred to ""The Organization Univeristy1 Employes Tina Allens In The Role Post Doc"" Because Full Professor is Preferred to Post Doc
The Relation ""the Context Audit Holds Between Tina Allen, Sign, and Dataset7 In The Organization University2"" Is Preferred to ""the Context Default Holds Between Tina Allan, Sign, And Dataset7 In the Organization University1"" Because Audit is Preferred to Default.
Since These Are Identical, No Preference Comparison is Needed.
Conclusion: since All Elements of the Permissions Support are Either Preferred to Or Match the Prohibitions Support, Access Is Granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1591;362;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule:** Access is granted by the decision rule if for every support from a prohibition there is a corresponding support from a permission such that the permission support is preferred to the prohibition support. 
**Outcome:** The permission for Chloe Walker to perform ""describe"" on ""agreement5"" is granted.
**Relations and Preferences:**
Permission Support Elements:
Role Assignment: The Organisation University3 employs Chloe Walker in the role ""researcher"". This is preferred to ""The Organisation Institute2 employs Chloe walker in the role 'post_doc'."" 
Reason: ""researcher"" is more preferred than ""post_doc"".
Context: The context ""secondment"" holds between Chloe Walker, ""describe"", and ""agreement 5"" in the Organisation University3. This is preferred over ""The context ""default"" holds between ""Chloe Walker"", ""describe"", ""and ""agreement"" 5 in the Organisation Institute2.""
Reason: ""Secondment"" is more preferable than ""default"".
Other Elements (no preference needed):
The Organisation University3 considers ""describe"" as a ""consult"" activity. This is the same as ""The Organisation institute2 considers ""describ"" as a 'consult' activity.""
Since these are the same, no preference needs to be compared.
The Organisation university3 uses ""agreement-5"" in ""the view ""secondment_report"". This is also the same as the ""organisation institute2 uses ""agreements"" in ""view ""secondment_reports"".
Since these are both the same, they do not need to be compared with each other.
Conclusion: Since all the elements of the ""permission's support"" are either ""preferred"" to or ""match"" the ""prohibition's support"", access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2211;283;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule:** Access is granted by the decision rule. 
**Outcome:** The permission for Mia_anderson to perform ""describe"" on ""dataset7"" is granted.
**Relations and Preferences:** 
Permission Support Elements:
Role Assignment: The organization institute1 employs ""Mia_Anderson"" in the role ""team_leader"". → Preferred over ""The organization institute2 employs ""MIA_ANDERSON"" in the ""role ""associate_professor"". 
Reason: ""team_leader"" is preferred to ""associate_professsor"". 
Context: The context ""audit"" holds between ""Mia_anderson"", ""describe"", and ""dataset_7"" in the organization institute1.→ Preferred over ""the context ""default"" holds betweeen ""Mia_Anderson"", ""describ"", and ""data_set_7""in the organization institute2.
Reason: ""audit"" is prefered to ""default"". 
Other Elements (no preference needed): 
Both permission and prohibition shares: 
The organization institute1 considers ""describe"" as a ""consult"" activity. 
The organization Institute1 uses ""dataset7""in the view ""WP4"". 
Since these are identical,no preference comparison is needed. 
Conclusion: Since all elemnts of the permission support are either prefereed to or match with the prohibition support, the access is granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1911;329;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule:** Access is granted by the decision rule, if and only it, for every prohibition, there is a corresponding permission, where the permission dominates the prohibition. A permission dominates a prohibition if every element in the permission support is preferred to an element in the prohibition support. 
**Outcome:** The permission for Mia_anderson to perform ""sign"" on ""agreement2"" is granted.
**Relations and Preferences:**
Permission Support Elements:
Role Assignment: The organization university1 employs Mia_Anderson In the role team leader. → Preferred Over the prohibition's Role assignment: The organization institute1 employs Mia Anderson in the role phd student. 
Reason: team leader is preferred to phd student.
Context: The context ""secondment"" holds between Mia Anderson, ""sign"", and ""agreement 2"" in the organization university1.→ Preferred Over the Prohibition's Context: the context ""collaboration"" holds between ""Mia Anderson"", ""Sign"", and ""Agreement2"" In the organization institute1.
Reason: ""Secondment"" is preferred to ""Collaboration"".
Other Elements (no Preference Needed):
Both Permission and Prohibition Share:
The organization consortium considers ""sign"" as a ""validate"" activity.
The organization university1 uses ""agreement1"" in the view ""administration"".
The organization institute1 uses ""Agreement1"" In the view ""WP4"".
Since these are identical No Preference Comparison Is Required.
Conclusion: Since All Elements Of The Permission's Support Are Either Preferred To Or Match The Prohibition's Support, Access Is Granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1627;1790;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule:** Access is granted by the decision rule if for every support for a prohibition there exists a support for the corresponding permission where the support for the permission dominates the support for prohibition. A support dominates another support if each element in the support for permission is strictly more preferred than at least one of the elements in the support of prohibition. 
**Outcome:** The access is not granted because the support for permissions does not dominate the support for prohibitions. 
**Relations and Preferences:** 
Permission Support Elements:
Role Assignment: The organization University2 employs Zane_Gonzelez in the role phd_student. 
Reason: phd_student is preferred to full_professor. 
Context: The context audit does not hold between zane_gonzelez, grep, report3, in the organization University2. 
Reasons: audit is not preferred to collaboration, so the context preference is not satisfied. 
Other Elements (no preference needed): 
Both permission and prohibition shares: 
The organization University1 employs zane_gonzales in the role Phd_student, 
The organization university2 employs zane gonzales in role phd student, 
Since these are identical no preference comparisons are needed. 
Conclusion: Since all the elements of the support for prohbition are preferred to the elements of support for permission, the access is denied.

The Access is not Granted because the Support for Permissions does not Dominate the Support for Probitions. 
***Relations and Preferences:*** 
Permission Support elements: 
Role assignment: The Organization University1 employs Zane_gonzales in Role phdstudent.
Reason: phdstudent is Preferred to Full_professor.
Context: The Context collaboration does not Hold between Zane gonzlaes, read, Report2 in the Organization University1.
Reason: collaboration is not Preferred to default, so the Context Preference is not Satisfied. 
Other elements (No Preference needed): 
both permission and Prohibition share: 
The Organization University1 Employes zane gonzales in role Phdstudent, 
The Organization university2 Employes zange gonzalesin role phdstudents, 
Since These are Identical No Preference Comparisons are Needed. 
Conclusion : Since all the Elements of the Support for prohibition are Preferred to the Elements of Support for Permission, the Access is Denied.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

**Outcome:** The permission's supports dominate the prohibition's supporters. 
**Relations and Preferences:** 
Permission Support Elements: Full_Professor is preferred over Staff_Member. 
Context: Audit is preferred over collaboration. 
Other Elements (No preference needed): 
Both permission and prohibition shares: 
The organisation Consortium considers Drop as a Modify Activity. 
The organisation University1 uses Report2 in the View WP4.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1805;256;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule:** Access is granted by the decision rule ""if and only if"" (i.e., ""iff""). This means that if the access is granted, then the decision rule is satisfied. If the access is denied, then the rule is not satisfied. 
**Outcome:** The outcome is that access is granted.
**Relations and Preferences:** 
Permission Support Elements:
Role Assignment: The organization University1 employs Katherine in the role student. → Preferred to the prohibition's assignment: The organization Institute1 employs Katherine_in the role researcher. 
Reason: student is preferred to researcher. 
Context: The context management_holds between Katherine, insert, agreement1 in organization University1. → Not preferred to the prohibition’s context: the context collaboration_holds between katherine, insert, aggrement1 in the organization Institute1. 
Other Elements (no preference needed): 
Both permission and prohibition shares: 
The organization University1 considers insert as modifying activity. 
The organization Institute1 uses agreement1. 
Since these elements are the same, they do not need to be compared. 
Conclusion: Since all the elements of the permissions support are preferred to or equal to the elements of its prohibition support, the decision is granted.

        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Input:1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if,         for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.         Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization Institute1 grants the role team_leader the Permission to perform the activity consult on the view internal_data if the context management holds,The organisation Institute1 employes Zane_Gonzalez in the role team_leader, The organisation Consortium considers ask as a consult activity, The organisation Institute1 uses agreement6 in the view internal_data, The context management holds between Zane_Gonzalez, ask, and agreement6 in the organisation Institute1,  
3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
(support 1): The organization University1 grants the role secondee the Prohibition to perform the activity consult on the view WP1 if the context collaboration holds,The organisation University1 employes Zane_Gonzalez in the role secondee, The organisation Consortium considers ask as a consult activity, The organisation University1 uses agreement6 in the view WP1, The context collaboration holds between Zane_Gonzalez, ask, and agreement6 in the organisation University1,  
4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation Institute1 employes Zane_Gonzalez in the role team_leader, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University1 employes Zane_Gonzalez in the role secondee, `` because: team_leader is preferred to secondee. 
The relation ``The context management holds between Zane_Gonzalez, ask, and agreement6 in the organisation Institute1, `` is preferred to ``The context collaboration holds between Zane_Gonzalez, ask, and agreement6 in the organisation University1, `` because: management is preferred to collaboration. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Zane_Gonzalez to perform ask on agreement6 is granted.

### Output:";1416;249;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when, for every element of a permission's support, there exists an element of a prohibition's support that is strictly preferred. 
**Outcome**: 
The access is granted by the permission because its support is preferred to the prohibition's' support. 
Specifically: 
The permission's support does not contain any elements that are preferred to elements in the inhibition's support.
**Relations and Preferences:** 
Permission Support Elements:
Role Assignment: The organization Institute 1 employs Zane Gonzales in the role Team Leader. 
Reason: Team Leader is preferred to Secondee.
Context: The context Management Holds between Zane Gonzalez, Ask, and Agreement6 in the organization Institute1.
Reason: Management is preferred to Collaboration.
Permission and Prohibition share: 
The organization Consortium considers Ask as a Consult Activity.
The organization Institute1 uses Agreement6 in View Internal Data.
The organization University1 uses Agreemnt6 in View WP1.
Since these elements are identical, they do not need to be compared.
Conclusion: Since none of the elements of the Permission's support are preferred to any elements of the Prohibition's support, the access is granted.

Reason: The Institute1 is preferred over the University1 and the Institute3.
Context: The collaboration holds between Scott, ""sign"", and ""report5"" in the institute1. → Prefered to the prohibition’s context. The collaboration does NOT hold between Scott,""sign"",and""report5""intheinstitute3ortheuniversity1.→Notpreferedtotheprohibition’scontext.
Reason: In the Institute1 the collaboration holds, but in the Institute3 and University1 it does not.
Other elements (no preference needed):
Both permission and Prohibition share:
The organization Consortium considers ""sign"" as a ""validate"" activity. 
The organization Consortium uses ""report5""in the view ""WP4"". 
Since these elements are the same, no preference comparisons are needed. 
Conclusion: Since the elements of the prohibition’s support are preferred to the elements of its permission’s support, the access is denied.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1796;292;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted if for every support for a prohibition, a corresponding support exists for a permission. A support is a list of elements that can be used to make a decision. Each element of a support must be strictly preferred to an element of the corresponding support for the permission. 
**Outcome**: 
The access is granted for the permission because its support dominates the support for the prohibition. 
**Relations and Preferences**:
Permission Support Elements:
Role Assignment: The organization University2 employs Chloe_Walker_in the role researcher. 
Reason: The role researcher is preferred over the role associate professor. 
Context: The context audit_holds_between Chloe_Walker_, drop_, and dataset1_in the organization University2. 
Reason:The context audit holds is preferred to the context collaboration_holds. 
Other Elements (no preference needed): 
Both permission and prohibition shares: 
The organization University1 employs Chloe Walker in the role Associate Professor. 
The organization Institute2 employs Chloe Walker_in the role wp leader. 
The context audit_helds_between Chloe Walker_, drop_,and dataset1_in both the organization University1 and the organization Institute2. 
Since these elements are the same in both the permission and the prohibition, no preference comparisons are needed. 
Conclusion: Since all the elements in the permission support are preferred to or identical to the elements of the prohibition support, the access is granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1829;237;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when, for every prohibition, there is a corresponding permission with a support that dominates that of the prohibition.
**Outcome**: 
The access is granted since the permission's supports dominate the prohibition's supports. Specifically:
The permission's supports contain elements that are strongly preferred to corresponding supports in the prohibition. 
**Relations and Preferences**:
**Permission Support Elements**:
**Role Assignment**: The organisation University1 employs David_Willings in the role Team_leader. 
**Reason**: Team_leader is preferred over post_doc.
**Context**: The context secondments holds between David_willings, ask, agreement1, in the organization University1.
**Reason**: Secondment is preferred over collaboration.
**Other Elements (No preference needed)**:
**Both permission and prohibition shares**:
**The organisation Consortium considers Ask as a Consult activity.**
**The organisation University1 uses Agreement1 in the View secondment_report.**
**Since these are identical no preference comparisons are required.**

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";2043;347;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule:** Access is granted when the permission's supports dominate the prohibition's supports. Dominance is defined as each element of a permission's support being strictly preferred to a corresponding element of a prohibition's support.
**Outcome:** The access was granted because the permissions' supports dominate the prohibitions' supports. Specifically:
The permission's supports contain elements that are more preferred than the prohibition's elements. 
**Relations and Preferences:** 
Permission Support Elements:
Role Assignment: The organization west hospital employs Xander_Ro-driguez in role specialist. → Preferred to the prohibition's assignment: The organization north hospital employs Xa-nder Rodriguez in role extern. 
Reason: specialist is more preferred than extern. 
Context: The context emergency hold between Xander Rodriguez, biopsy and sample 1 in the organization west hospital.→ Preferred to the pro-hibition's context: the context afternoon hold be-tween Xander Rod-ri-guez, biopsy and sam-ple 1in the organization north hospital. 
Rea-son: emer-gency is more pref-erred than af-ternoon. 
Other Elements (no preference needed): 
Both permission and pro-hi-bition share: 
The organization central hospital considers bi-opsy as a analyze acti-vity. 
The organization west hospital uses sample 1in view medical file. 
Since these are identi-cal, no preference com-parison is re-quired. 
Conclu-sion: Since all ele-ments of the per-mission's sup-port are either pre-ferred to or ma-ch the prohibi-tion's sup-port, ac-cess is granted.

        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization north_hospital grants the role hospital_doctor the Permission to perform the activity analyze on the view admin_data if the context referent_doctor holds,The organisation north_hospital employes Dylan_Nelson in the role hospital_doctor, The organisation central_hospital considers biopsy as a analyze activity, The organisation north_hospital uses patinet_medical_data_5 in the view admin_data, The context referent_doctor holds between Dylan_Nelson, biopsy, and patinet_medical_data_5 in the organisation north_hospital,  
3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
(support 1): The organization east_hospital grants the role student the Prohibition to perform the activity analyze on the view admin_data if the context sample_analysis holds,The organisation east_hospital employes Dylan_Nelson in the role student, The organisation central_hospital considers biopsy as a analyze activity, The organisation east_hospital uses patinet_medical_data_5 in the view admin_data, The context sample_analysis holds between Dylan_Nelson, biopsy, and patinet_medical_data_5 in the organisation east_hospital,  
4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation north_hospital employes Dylan_Nelson in the role hospital_doctor, `` is preferred to ``The organisation east_hospital employes Dylan_Nelson in the role student, `` because: hospital_doctor is preferred to student. 
The relation ``The context referent_doctor holds between Dylan_Nelson, biopsy, and patinet_medical_data_5 in the organisation north_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context sample_analysis holds between Dylan_Nelson, biopsy, and patinet_medical_data_5 in the organisation east_hospital, `` because: referent_doctor is preferred to sample_analysis. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Dylan_Nelson to perform biopsy on patinet_medical_data_5 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:

### Output:";1461;720;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule:** Access is granted by the decision rule if for every support for a prohibition there exists a support for the corresponding permission where the support for the permission is preferred to the support for its corresponding prohibition. 
**Outcome:** The outcome is that the access is granted.
**Relations and Preferences:** 
Permission Support Elements:
Role Assignment: The north_hospital employs Dylan_Nelson as a hospital_doctor. → Preferred to the student assignment in the east_hospital. 
Reason: Hospital_Doctor is preferred over student. 
Context: The context refers to Dylan_Nelson performing the analyze activity on the medical_data_5. This is preferred over the sample_analysis context. 
Other Elements (no preference needed): 
Both permission and prohibition shares: 
The north_hospital considers the analyze activity. 
The east_hospital also considers the same activity. 
Since these are the same, no preference comparisons are needed. 
Conclusion: Since all the elements in the permission support are preferred to the elements of the prohibition support, the permission is granted.

### **Input:1. Overall Logic:** Explain why the access is denied. An access must be denied if and only         if, for some support of a permitted activity, there exists another support of a prohibited activity         where the permitted activity's support is not preferred to the prohibited activity's support. Here are         the different elements that influence the decision. 2. Supports of Permitted Activity: List of         the elements that comprise the permitted activity supports: 
3. Supports of Prohibited Activity: A list of the elements comprising the prohibited activity support: 
4. Preferences Between the Elements: 
5. The Decision: The outcome of this logical inference is that the permission is denied. 
### Request for Explanation: 
Using the logic, supports and preferences provided, please explain the decision making process (why         the access was denied or granted). Please follow the structure below:
1. Decision Rule: [Provide the rule used to make the decision.]
2. Outcome: [Describe the outcome of the decision clearly and succinctly.]
3. Relations and Preferences: [Explain all the relations and preferences influencing the decision.         Include all relevant details.]
Make sure to follow the structure exactly and make sure each section is completed.

### Output:
Here is the explanation of the denial:
**Decision rule:** Access must be denied by the rule if for some support for a permitted activity         there exists a supporting activity for a prohibited activity where the permitted support is not         preferred to the activity's prohibited support.
**Outcome:** Access is denied because the permitted support for the permitted activity is not preferred         to the prohibited support for the prohibited activity. 
**Relations and preferences:** 
Permitted activity support elements: 
Role assignment: Dylan_Nelson is employed as a student in the central_hospital. → Not preferred to the         hospital_doctor assignment in the north_hospital.
Reason: Student is not preferred over hospital_doctor.
Context: The sample_analysis context holds between Dylan_nelson, the analyze activity, and the medical_data5.         This is not prefered to the referent doctor context in the north hospital.
Other elements (no preference): 
Both permitted and prohibited activities share: 
The central_hospital and north_hospital both consider the analyze activity.
Since these are identical no preference comparisons need to be made.
**Conclusion:** Since the permitted support of the permitted activity does not dominate the prohibited         support of the prohibited activity, the permission must be denied.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

Context: The context Anesthesic\_Patient holds between Henry\_Lee, Biopsy, and Prescription\_1 in the organization North\_Hospital.
Reason: Anesthesic_Patient is preferred to Sample\_Analysis.
Other Elements (no preference needed):
Both permission and prohibition shares:
The organization south\_hospital considers Biopsy as a Analyze activity.
The organization north\_Hospital and the organization south\_Hospital use Prescription\_1 on the view Personal\_Data and Prescribtion\_Data, respectively.
Since these elements are identical, they do not need to be compared.
Conclusion: Since all the elements of the Permission's support are preferred to or identical to the elements in the Prohibition's support, the access is granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2020;192;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule:** Access is granted when the permission's supports dominate the prohibition's supports. 
**Outcome:** The permission's supports contain elements that are preferred to the prohibition's elements. 
**Relations and Preferences:** 
**Permission Support Elements:** 
**Prohibition Support Elements:** 

Both dominance conditions (Role Preference and Context Preference) are satisfied.

**Role Preference:** 
The permission's role preference is satisfied. The permission's role is preferred to the corresponding prohibition's role. 
Reason: Surgeon is preferred to Extern. 

**Context Preference:** 
In this case, the permission's context preference is not satisfied. The prohibition's context is preferred to its corresponding permission's context. 

**No Preference Needed:** 
There are no preference comparisons needed between the permission and prohibition's other elements. 

**Conclusion:** Since the permission's elements are preferred to those of the prohibition, the access is granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";2031;334;"1. The decision rule is: Access is granted when the permission's supports dominate the prohibition's supports. 
2. The outcome is: The permission's supports contain elements that are preferred to the prohibition's supporters. 
3. The relations and preferences are: 
The permission's supports: 
Role Assignment: The organization south hospital employs Xander Rodriguez in the role Anesthetist. 
Reason: Anesthetists are preferred to medical secretaries. 
Context: The context Referent Doctor Holds between Xander Rodriguez, a Operate, and Patinet Admin Data 4 in the organization south hospital. 
Reasons: Referent Doctor is preferred to No Anesthesia. 
Other Elements (no preference needed): 
The organization south hospital considers a Operate as a Operate Activity. 
The Organization South Hospital Uses Patinet Admin data 4 In The View Prescribtion Data. 
The organization east hospital employs xander rodriquez in the role Medical Secretary. 
The Organisation Central Hospital Considers A Operate As A Operate activity. 
The organisation east hospital uses patinet admin data 4 in The view personal data. 
The context afternoon Holds Between Xander Rodriquez, A Operate, And Patinent Admin Data 5 In The Organisation East Hospital. 
The Context No Anesthesia Holds Between xander rodiguez, a operare, and patinent admin data 5 in the organization east hospital.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2436;324;"Here is an explanation of the decision rule and outcome:
**Decision Rule:** Access is granted when the permission's supports are preferred to the prohibition's supports. 
**Outcome:** The permission's supports contain elements that are preferred to elements in the inhibition's supports. In this case, the permission's and prohibition's supports are identical. 
**Relations and Preferences:** 
Permission Support Elements:
Role Assignment: The organisations east_hospital and west_hospital both employ Amelia_King as anesthetists. → Preferred to the prohibition assignment: The organisations north_hospital and central_hospital employ Amelia King as medical_secretaries. 
Reason: anesthets are preferred to medical secretaries. 
Context: The contexts intern_presc_hours and referent_doctors both hold between Amelia King and select and patinet_data_admin_5 in east_hospitals and west_hospitals, respectively. →Preferred to the prohibition context: The contexts no_anesthesis and afternoon both holds between Amelia King, select and patinent_data_admim_5 in north_hospita and central_hospita, respectively. 
Other Elements (No preference needed): 
Both permission and prohibition shares: 
The organisation central_hospitals considers selects as a consult activities. 
The organisations east_hosptial and west_hosptials both use patinent_data_admins_5 in their personal_data views. 
Since these elements are identical, they do not need to be compared. 
Conclusion: Since all the elements of the permissions supports are either preferred or identical to the prohibition supports, the access is granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1912;1838;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule:** Access is granted when the permission's supports dominate the prohibition's supports. 
**Outcome:** The access was granted because the permissions' supports dominate the prohibitions' supports. 
Specifically: 
The permission's supports contain elements that are preferred to the corresponding elements of the prohibitions. 
**Relations and Preferences:** 
Permission Support Elements:
Role Assignment: The organization west hospital employs Katherine Moore in the role Doctor. 
Reason: Doctor is preferred to Extern. 
Context: The context Emergency holds between Katherine Moore, Delegate, and Prescription 5 in the organization west hospital.
Reason: Emergency is preferred to No Anesthesia. 
Other Elements (no preference needed): 
The organization west hospital considers Delegate as a Handle Activity. 
The organization east hospital employs Katherine Moire in the role External. 
Since these are the same, no preference comparisons are needed. 
Conclusion: Since all the elements of the permissions' support are preferred to or the same as the elements of their corresponding prohibitions' support, access was granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support:

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation east_hospital employes Rachel_Baker in the role liberal_doctor, `` is preferred to ``The organisation south_hospital employes Rachel_Baker in the role patient, `` because: liberal_doctor is preferred to patient. 
The relation ``The context emergency holds between Rachel_Baker, delegate, and prescription_3 in the organisation east_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context no_anesthesia holds between Rachel_Baker, delegate, and prescription_3 in the organisation south_hospital, `` because: emergency is preferred to no_anesthesia. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Rachel_Baker to perform delegate on prescription_3 is granted.

### Output:";1431;292;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when, for every prohibition, there is a corresponding permission such that the permission dominates the prohibition. A permission dominates a prohibition if each element of its support is strictly better than at least one of the elements of its support. 
**Outcome**: 
The access is granted since the permission's supports dominate the prohibition's supports. 
**Relations and Preferences:** 
Permission Support Elements:
Role Assignment: The organization central_hospital employs Rachel Baker in the role Liberal_Doctor. → Preferred Over the Prohibition's Role Assignment: 
The organization south hospital employes Rachel baker in the role Patient. 
Reason: Liberal_Doctor is preferred over Patient. 
Context: The context emergency hold between Rachel Baker, Delegate, and prescription 3 in the organization east hospital. 
→ Preferred Over The Prohibition's Context: 
The context no anesthesia hold between Rachel baker, Delegate, And prescription 3 In the organization south hospital. 
Reason : Emergency is preferred over no anesthesia. 
Other Elements (No preference needed): 
Both Permission and Prohibition share: 
The Organization central hospital considers delegate as handle activity. 
The Organization east hospital uses prescription 3 on view prescripton_data. 
Since these are identical no preference comparisons are required. 
Conclusion: Since All Elements Of The Permission's Support Are Either Preferred To Or Match The Prohibition'S Support, Access Is Granted.

**Outcome:** The permission for Victor Turner to perform prescribe appointment on patinet admin data 3 is granted.
**Relations and Preferences:**
**Permission Support Elements:**
**Role Assignment:** The organisation east hospital employs Victor Turner in the role Hospital Doctor. → Preferred Over The Prohibition's Role Assignment: Victor Turner is employed in the role Extern by the organisation east hospital.
**Reason:** Hospital Doctor is preferred to Extern.
**Context:** The context intern presc hour holds between Victor Turner, prescribe appointment, and patinent admin data three in the organization east hospital.→ Preferred Over The prohibition's Context: Intern Presc Hour is preferred to Afternoon.
**Other Elements (no Preference Needed):**
**Both Permission and Prohibition share:**
The organisation central hospital considers prescribe appointment as a prescribe actvity.
The organisation east hospital uses patinent admin date three in the view medial data.
The organisation west hospital uses patrient admin data threein the view medical file.
Since these are identical no preference comparision is required.
**Conclusion:** Since all elemnts of the permssion's suppo are either prefereed to or match with the prohibition's supppo, the access is granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

Context: The context refers to doctor holds between James Wilsons, list and prescription 2 in the organization west hospital. → Preferred To the prohibition's contex: The context sample analysis holds between James Wilsons, list and prescript 2 in organization north hospital.
Reason: refers to doctor is preferred to Sample analysis. 
Other elements (no preference needed): 
Both permission and prohibition shares: 
The organization central hospital consider list as a Consult activity. 
The organization west hospital use prescription 2 on the view Medical data. 
Since these are identical no preference comparisons are required. 
Conclusion: Since all the elements of the permissions support are either prefered to or matches the prohibition support, the access is granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

Access is granted when the permission's supports are preferred to the prohibition's supports. 
**Outcome**: 
Ben_Foster is granted the permission to perform the operation aOperate with sample_2. 
**Relations and Preferences:** 
The permission's supports contain elements that are preferred to elements in the inhibition's supports. Specifically, the permission's role preference is preferred to the inhibition's role preference. The permission's context preference is preferred over the inhibition's context preference. 
The permission and inhibition share: 
The organisation central_hospitals considers aoperate as an operate activity. 
The organisation north hospital and the organisation east hospital use sample2 in the views medical_file and sample respectively. 
Since these elements are identical, they do not need to be compared. 
Conclusion: The permission's supports dominate the inhibition's support. Access is granted.
