### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1837;444;"**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohibition support. This means that the elements in the permission support are either strictly preferred to or equal to the elements from the corresponding prohibition support. 

**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all the permission supports dominate their corresponding prohibition supports. In other words, each element in the permission supports is either strictly preferred or equal to its corresponding element in the prohibition supports.

**Explanation**: 
1. **Permission Support Elements**: 
- Role Assignment: 
  - The organization Institute 3 employs Chloe Walker in the role of full professor.
  - This role is preferred to the role of PhD student in the organization University 1.
- Context: 
   - The context of ""management"" holds between Chloe Walker, ""edit"", and ""report 2"" in the organization Institute3.
   - This context is preferred over the context of ""default"" holding between the same entities in the University 1 organization.
- Activity: 
    - The organization Consortium considers ""edit"" as a ""modify"" activity.
    - This activity is the same in both the permission and prohibition supports.
- View: 
     - Both organizations, Institute 3 and University 1, use ""report2"" in ""administration"" and ""data"" views, respectively.
     - These views are the same, so no preference is needed.
2. **Prohibition Support Elements**:
 - Role Assignment:
   - Similar to the permission support, but with the role of ""PhD student"" instead of ""full professor"".
 - Context:
    - Same as the permission support.
 - Activity:
    Same as the permission activity.
 - View:
    Similar to the permission view, but in the ""data"" view instead of ""administration"".
**Conclusion**: 
Since all the elements in each permission support are preferred to or the same as the corresponding elements in their respective prohibition supports, the access is granted for Chloe Walker to perform ""edit"" on ""report2"".

### Output:";1447;325;"Here is an example explanation:
**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates it. Dominance occurs when each element in the permission support is preferred to or matches at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted. This is because the permission’s support dominated the prohibition’s support.
Specifically: 
The permission support contained elements that were preferred to or matched the prohibition support’s elements.
Both dominance conditions were satisfied.
**Relations and preferences**: 
Permission support elements: 
Role assignment: The Organisation University1 employs Bob_Smith as a team_leader. 
→ Preferred over the role assignment in the prohibition: The Organisation Institute3 employs him as a secondee.
Reason: Team_Leader is preferred to Secondee.
Context: The secondment context holds between them, the sign activity, and the report1 document in the Organisation University1. 
Preferred over the collaboration context in the prohibition. 
Reason: The Secondment context is preferred to the Collaboration context.
Other elements (no preference needed): 
Both the permission and the prohibition share:
The Organisation Consortium considers sign to be a validate activity.
The Organisation University1 uses Report1 in the View Secondment_Report.
Since these are the same, there is no need for a preference comparison.
Conclusion: As all the elements in the permission' support were either preferred or matched those in the prohibition’ support, access has been granted.

        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports:

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1842;404;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule**: Access is granted if there exists a permission support that dominates the prohibition support.
**Outcome**: The access was granted because there is a permission support (the researcher role) that dominates the corresponding prohibition support (the secondee role). This is due to the preference of the researcher role over the secondee role.
**Explanation of Relations and Preferences**:
1. **Permission Support Elements**:
- **Role Assignment**: The organization grants the researcher role to Nathan_White.
- **Context**: The context ""secondment"" holds between the user, the activity ""copy"", and the dataset ""dataset10"" in the organization ""Institute3"".
- **Activity**: The activity ""copy"" is considered a ""modify"" activity by the organization ""Consortium"".
2. **Prohibition Support Elements**: 
- **Prohibition Role Assignment**: The organisation grants the role ""secondee"" to the user ""Nathan_White"" in the role ""WP2"".
- The context ""collaboration"" holds between ""WP2"" and ""Nathan_white"" in the organisation ""Institute3""
- The organisation ""Consortium"" considers ""copy"" as a ""modifying"" activity.
- The dataset ""dataset9"" is used in the view ""confidential_data"" by the organisation ""consortium"".
**Preferences**:
- The role ""coordinator"" is preferred to the role ""researcher"", which is preferred to ""secondee"". This is because ""coordinator"" has a higher level of authority than ""researcher"" and ""secondee"", respectively.
- Similarly, the context ""audit"" is preferred over the context ""collaboration"", as ""audit"" represents a more formal and controlled environment.
**Conclusion**: Since the permission support (researcher role) dominates the prohibition (secondee role) due to the preferences between the roles and contexts, the access is granted to the user.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2280;551;"Here is an explanation: 
**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when, for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates it. Dominance occurs when each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches the corresponding element in the prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all the permission supports dominate the prohibition supports. 
Specifically: 
The permission supports contain elements that are either strictly preferred or match the elements in the corresponding prohibition supports. Both the role preference and the context preference are satisfied.
**Relations and Preference**: 
Permission Supports: 
1. **Role Assignment**: The organization ""Institute3"" employs ""Dylan_Nelson"" in the role ""researcher"". This is preferred over the corresponding role assignment in the prohibition: ""The organization ""Institute1"" employs Dylan_Nelson""in the role ""PhD_student"". Reason: ""researcher"" is preferred to ""PhD_Student"".
2. **Context**: The context ""audit"" holds between ""Dylan Nelson"", ""move"", and ""dataset3"" in the ""organization ""Institute3"""". This is preferred to the corresponding context in the prohibitions: ""The context ""collaboration"" holds between Dylan Nelson, move and dataset3"" in ""the organization ""University1"""". Reason: ""audit"" is preferred over ""collaboration"".
3. Role Assignment: The organization ""University2"" employs Dylan Nelson in the role of ""team_leader"". This is also preferred to the role assignments in the prohibitions.
4. Context: The context ""management"" holds in the ""organisation ""University2"""". This context is also preferred over the contexts in the prohibition.
5. Role assignment: ""The organisation ""University2"""" employs ""Dylan Nelson"" in the position of ""full_professor"". This is still preferred to the remaining role assignments in prohibitions.
6. The context ""secondment"" holds in ""the organisation"" ""University2"". This context is still preferred over the remaining contexts in the remaining prohibitions.
Prohibition Supports:
1. The organization ""Consortium"" considers ""move"" as a ""modify"" activity.
2. The organisation ""Institute3"", ""University2"", and ""University1"" all use ""dataset3"""" in the view ""confidential_data"", ""secondment_agreement"", and ""data"", respectively.
Since these elements are identical in both the permission and prohibition supports, there is no need for a preference comparison.
Conclusion: As all elements in the permission supports are either preferred or match their counterparts in the prohibition supports, the access is granted to Dylan Nelson to perform ""move"" on ""dataset3"".

### Output:";1652;226;"Here is an example explanation:
**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates it. Dominance occurs when each element in the permission support is preferred over at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because both permission supports dominate their corresponding prohibition supports.
Specifically: 
1. The first permission support (full_professor, audit) is preferred to the first prohibition support (associate_professor, collaboration).
2. The second permission support (management) is also preferred to the second prohibition support (collaboration).
Since both permission supports are preferred to their corresponding prohibitions, access was granted.
**Relations and References**: 
Permission Supports:
1. Full_professor: Preferred over Associate_professor.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2910;555;"Here is an example explanation:
**Decision Rule**: Access is granted if there exists a permission support for each prohibition support, where the permission support is preferred to the prohibition support.
**Outcome**: The access is granted due to the following reasons:
1. The permission support contains elements preferred to or matching the prohibition support elements.
2. Both the permission and prohibition support share common elements.
3. All elements in the permission support are preferred or match the elements in the corresponding prohibition support, leading to the grant of access.
**Relations and References**:
1. Permission Support Elements:
- Role Assignment: The organization University 2 employs Wendy_Mitchell as a wp_leader.
- Context: The context ""audit"" holds between ""Wendy_Mitchell"", ""move"", and ""agreement4"" in the organization ""University 2"".
- Activity: The organization ""Consortium"" considers ""move"" as a ""modify"" activity.
- View: The organization “University 2” uses “agreement4” in the view “WP5”.
2. Prohibition Support Elements (preferred to the permission support elements):
- Role Assignments:
  - The organization ""Institute 3"" employs Wendy Mitchell as a ""PhD_student"" (preferred to ""wp_leader"").
  - Organization ""University 1"" employs ""Wendy Mitchell"" as ""associate_professor"" (not preferred to ""team_leader"" or ""post_doc"" or ""secondee"").
- Contexts (preferred to permission support contexts):
  - ""The context ""default"" holds between Wendy Mitchell, move and agreement4"" in ""organization Institute 3"" (preferred over ""audit"" context).
  - “The context ""collaboration"" holds between “Wendy Mitchell”, “move”, and “agreement4""” in “organization University 1” (preferred over “audit” context).
- Activity (preferred over permission support activity): The organization “Consortium” considers “move” as a “modify” activity (preferred over the permission support activity).
- View (preferred over permissions support view): The organization ""University1"" uses ""agreement 4"" in view ""WP 2"" (preferred).
3. Other Elements (no preference needed):
- Both permission and prohibition shared elements:
  The organization ""University2"" uses ""WP5"" in the view ""WP5"".
  The activity ""move"" is considered as ""modify"" by the ""Consortium"".
  ""Wendy_Mitchell"" is employed by the ""University2"".
Conclusion: Since the permission support has elements that are either preferred or match those in the prohibition support, access has been granted.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2647;382;"**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when there exists a permission with a support that dominates the support of every prohibition. Dominance is achieved when each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches the corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because there are permissions with supports that dominate the supports of all prohibitions. 

Specifically: 
1. The permission from the organization University3 has a support that matches the prohibition from the organization Institute2. 
2. The permission also has a matching support with the prohibition from organization Institute1. 
3. Additionally, the permission from organization Institute3 has supports that match the prohibitions from organizations Institute2 and Institute1.

In all cases, the elements in the permission supports either match or are preferred to the corresponding elements in their respective prohibition supports. 

Therefore, the access is granted due to the dominance of the permission supports over the prohibition supports.

**Relations and Preference**: 
For the permission from University3 and the prohibition from Institute2: 
- Role Preference: The role ""researcher"" is preferred over ""secondee"". 
- Context Preference: The context ""audit"" is preferred to the context ""default"". 

For the same permission and the other prohibition from Institute1: 
Same role and context preferences as above. 

Finally, for the permission from Institute3 and the prohibitions from Institute2 and then Institute1:
- Role Preferences: ""coordinator"" and ""researcher"", respectively, are preferred to ""secondee"" in both cases.
- Context Preferences: ""secondment"" and ""management"" are preferred over ""default"" in both instances. 

Thus, in each case, the permission support either matches or is preferred to its corresponding prohibition support, leading to the granting of the access.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2874;1801;**Decision Rule:** Access is granted if there exists a permission support for each prohibition support, where the permission support is preferred to the prohibition support. **Outcome:** The access is granted since the permission supports are preferred over the prohibition supports. This is due to the following reasons: 1. Role Preference: The permission role (wp_leader) is preferred over the corresponding prohibition roles (post_doc, staff_member). 2. Context Preference: The context (secondment, audit, management) associated with the permission supports is preferred over those associated with the prohibition supports (collaboration, default). 3. Activity Preference: The activity (modify) is the same for both permission and prohibition supports. 4. Organization Preference: The organizations (University1, Institute3, Institute2) associated with permission supports are not preferred over those (Institute3) associated with prohibition supports. However, they are not inferior either. 5. Dataset Preference: The dataset (dataset8) associated with all supports is the same, so no preference is needed. 6. View Preference: The views (contracts, administration, internal\_data, secondment\_report, WP3, WP5, reports, WP5) associated with supports are different, but none is preferred over another. 7. Role Assignment Preference: The role assignments (wp\_leader, coordinator, post\_doc, staff\_member) are preferred in the following order: wp\_leader > coordinator > post\_doc > staff\_member. 8. Context Preference Order: The context preferences are as follows: secondment > audit > management > collaboration > default. 9. Activity Preference Order: All activities (modify) have the same preference. 10. Organization Preference Order: There is no preference order among the organizations. 11. Dataset Preference Order: No preference is needed as the dataset is the same across all supports. 12. View Preference Order: None of the views are preferred over others. 13. Role Assignment Order: The order of role assignments is as follows: role_1 > role_2 > role_3 > role_4. 14. Context Order: The contexts are ordered as follows: context_1 > context_2 > context_3 > context_4 > context_5 > context_6. 15. Activity Order: The activities have the same order: activity_1 > activity_2 > activity_3 > activity_4 > activity_5 > activity_6 > activity_7 > activity_8 > activity_9 > activity_10. 16. Organization Order: The organizations have no order. 17. Dataset Order: No order is needed as all datasets are the same. 18. View Order: The views have no order: view_1 > view_2 > view_3 > view_4 > view_5 > view_6 > view_7 > view_8 > view_9 > view_10 > view_n. 19. Role Order: The roles are ordered: role_a > role_b > role_c > role_d > role_e > role_f > role_g > role_h > role_i > role_j > role_k > role_l > role_m > role_n > role_o > role_p > role_q > role_r > role_s > role_t > role_u > role_v > role_w > role_x > role_y > role_z > role_aa > role_ab > role_ac > role_ad > role_ae > role_af > role_ag > role_ah > role_ai > role_aj > role_ak > role_al > role_am > role_an > role_ao > role_ap > role_aq > role_ar > role_as > role_at > role_au > role_av > role_aw > role_ax > role_ay > role_az > role_ba > role_bb > role_bc > role_bd > role_be > role_bf > role_bg > role_bh > role_bi > role_bj > role_bk > role_bl > role_bm > role_bn > role_bo > role_bp > role_bq > role_br > role_bs > role_bt > role_bu > role_bv > role_bw > role_bx > role_by > role_bz > role_ca > role_cb > role_cc > role_cd > role_ce > role_cf > role_cg > role_ch > role_ci > role_cj > role_ck > role_cl > role_cm > role_cn > role_co > role_cp > role_cq > role_cr > role_cs > role_ct > role_cu > role_cv > role_cw > role_cx > role_cy > role_cz > role_da > role_db > role_dc > role_dd > role_de > role_df > role_dg > role_dh > role_di > role_dj > role_dk > role_dl > role_dm > role_dn > role_do > role_dp > role_dq > role_dr > role_ds > role_dt > role_du > role_dv > role_dw > role_dx > role_dy > role_dz > role_ea > role_eb > role_ec > role_ed > role_ee > role_ef > role_eg > role_eh > role_ei > role_ej > role_ek > role_el > role_em > role_en > role_eo > role_ep > role_eq > role_er > role_es > role_et > role_eu > role_ev > role_ew > role_ex > role_ey > role_ez > role_fa > role_fb > role_fc > role_fd > role_fe > role_ff > role_fg > role_fh > role_fi > role_fj > role_fk > role_fl > role_fm > role_fn > role_fo > role_fp > role_fq > role_fr > role_fs > role_ft > role_fu > role_fv > role_fw > role_fx > role_fy > role_fz > role_ga > role_gb > role_gc > role_gd > role_ge > role_gf > role_gg > role_gh > role_gi > role_gj > role_gk > role_gl > role_gm > role_gn > role_go > role_gp > role_gq > role_gr > role_gs > role_gt > role_gu > role_gv > role_gw > role_gx > role_gy > role_gz > role_ha > role_hb > role_hc > role_hd > role_he > role_hf > role_hg > role_hh > role_hi > role_hj > role_hk > role_hl > role_hm > role_hn > role_ho > role_hp > role_hq > role_hr > role_hs > role_ht > role_hu > role_hv > role_hw > role_hx > role_hy > role_hz > role_ia > role_ib > role_ic > role_id > role_ie > role_if > role_ig > role_ih > role_ii > role_ij > role_ik > role_il > role_im > role_in > role_io > role_ip > role_iq > role_ir > role_is > role_it > role_iu > role_iv > role_iw > role_ix > role_iy > role_iz > role_ja > role_jb > role_jc > role_jd > role_je > role_jf > role_jg > role_jh > role_ji > role_jj > role_jk > role_jl > role_jm > role_jn > role_jo > role_jp > role_jq > role_jr > role_js > role_jt > role_ju > role_jv > role_jw > role_jx > role_jy > role_jz > role_ka > role_kb > role_kc > role_kd > role_ke > role_kf > role_kg >;0.5481048583984375;0.54522705078125;0.3893890380859375;0.34228515625;0.939453125;0.475830078125;0.7911975435005117;42.75;14.3;13.9;15.0;20.19;26.2

        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share:

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2260;368;"**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when, for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohibition support. This means that the elements in the permission support are either strictly preferred to or equal to the elements from the corresponding prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all the permission supports dominate their corresponding prohibition supports.
**Explanation**: 
1. **Permission Support 1**: 
- **Role Assignment**: The organization ""Institute3"" employs ""Liam_Taylor"" in the role ""researcher"". This is preferred to the role ""staff_member"" in the prohibition support 1.
- **Context**: The context ""secondment"" is preferred to ""collaboration"".
- **Activity**: The activity ""insert"" is considered a ""modify"" activity by the organization ""Consortium"". This is equal to the activity in the prohibition supports 1, 2, and 3 since they all consider ""insert"" as ""modify"".
- Other Elements: All other elements are equal across all supports.
2. **Permission Supports 2 and 3**: 
These supports are similar to the first permission support, but with different role assignments and contexts.
- In support 2, the organization ""Institute1"" employs Liam_Taylor as a ""coordinator"", which is preferred to being a ""staff member"". The context ""audit"" is also preferred to ""default"".
- Similarly, in support 3, Liam_Taylor is employed as a ""wp_leader"" and the context is ""audit"", both preferred to their counterparts in support 2.
**Conclusion**: 
Since all permission supports dominate the corresponding prohibition supports, the access is granted to Liam_Taylor for performing ""insert"" on ""report6"".

        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports:

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1431;1010;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule**: Access is granted if there exists a permission support for each prohibition support, and the permission support dominates the corresponding prohibition support.
**Outcome**: The access was granted.
**Explanation**: The decision was based on the following relations and preferences:
1. **Permission Support Elements**:
   - **Role Assignment**: The organization **University1** employs **Ursula_Carter** in the role **researcher**. This is preferred to the role **post_doc** in the organization **Institute2** because **researcher** is considered more suitable for the activity **consult** on the view **deliverables** in the context **audit**.
2. **Context**: The context **audit** is preferred to **default** because **audit** provides a more specific and relevant context for the activity.
**Conclusion**: Since the permission support elements are preferred to the prohibition support elements, the decision was to grant the access.

### Input: 1. Overall Logic: Explain the overall logic behind the decision. 2. Supports of Permission: List the elements that make up the permission support. 3. Supports of Prohibition: List the components of the prohibition support. 4. Preferences Between the Elements: Explain the preferences between the elements. 5. The Decision: Describe the outcome of the decision.
### Output: Here's an example explanation:
**Overall Logic**: The decision is based on the concept of ""dominance,"" where the permission support must dominate the prohibition support for the access to be granted. Dominance is achieved when each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches the corresponding element in the prohibition support in terms of role, context, activity, and view.
**Supports of Permission**:
1. The organization ""University1"" grants the role ""researcher"" to ""Ursula_Carter"" for the activity ""consult"" on the view ""deliverables"" in the context ""audit.""
2. The organization considers ""read"" as a ""consult"" activity.
3. The organization uses ""report7"" in the view ""data.""
4. The context ""audit"" is preferred to ""default"" because ""audit"" provides a more focused and relevant context.
**Support of Prohibition**:
The organization ""Institute2"" prohibits the role ""post_doc"" from performing the activity ""read"" on the same view ""data"" in the same context ""default.""
**Preference Between the Elements**:
- The role assignment in the permission (""researcher"") is preferred over the prohibition (""post_doc"").
- The context (""audit"") in the permission is preferred over (""default"") in the prohibition.
- The activity (""read"") and view (""data"") are the same in both permission and prohibition, so there's no preference needed.
**Decision**: Based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support, the decision is to grant access to Ursula_Carter for reading ""report7.""

### Response:
Here's an explanation of how the decision was made:
- **Decision Rule:** The decision was made based on the ""dominance"" rule, which states that access is granted when the permission support element dominates the prohibition support element.
- **Outcome:** Access was granted to Ursula Carter to perform the ""read"" activity on the ""data"" view in the ""audit"" context.
- ***Relations and Preferences***:
  1. **Role Assignment:** The role assigned to Ursula Carter in the permission (researcher) was preferred over the role assigned in the prohibition (post_doc).
  2. **Activity:** The activity (read) was identical in both the permission and prohibition.
  3. **View:** The view (data) was also identical in both cases.
  4. **Context:** The context (audit) in the permission was preferred to the context (default) in the prohibition due to its more specific and focused nature.
  5. **Organization:** The organizations (University1 and Institute2) were the same, so there was no preference needed in this aspect.
  6. **Report:** The report (report7) was used in the permission but not in the prohibition, leading to a preference in favor of the permission.
Based on these relations and preferences, it was determined that the permission support dominated the prohibition support according to the dominance rule, resulting in the decision to grant access.

**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates it. Dominance occurs when each element in the permission support is preferred over at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all the elements in the permission supports are either preferred or match those in the prohibition supports. Specifically:
- The permission's role (researcher) is preferred over the prohibition roles (post_doc and secondee).
- The context (audit) in the permission is preferred over both contexts (collaboration) in the prohibition.
- The activity (consult) is the same in both supports.
- Both supports use the same view (public_data and confidential_data).
- All elements in the supports are from the same organization (Institute3 and Institute2).
Conclusion: Since the permission supports dominate the prohibition supports, access was granted.

### Output:";2752;713;"**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when there exists a permission support for each prohibition support, such that the permission support dominates the corresponding prohibition support. This means that the elements in the permission support are either strictly preferred to or equal to the elements in their corresponding prohibition supports.
**Outcome**: 
Access is granted because all permission supports dominate the corresponding prohibition supports, satisfying the decision rule. Specifically:
1. The permission support for the role ""full_professor"" is preferred to the prohibition support for the roles ""associate_professor"", ""post_doc"", and ""PhD_student"".
2. The context ""audit"" in the organization ""University1"" is preferred over the contexts ""collaboration"" in the organizations ""University1"", ""Institute1"", and ""Institute3"".
3. The organization ""Institute1"" employs ""Amelia_King"" in the role ""post_doctoral_researcher"", which is preferred to ""Institute3"" employing her in the role of ""PhD student"".
4. The context of ""secondment"" holds in ""Institute1,"" which is preferred over ""collaboration"" holding in the same organization.
5. The activity ""edit"" is considered a ""modify"" activity by the organization ""Consortium"".

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1640;231;"Here is an example explanation:
**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohibition support. This means that the elements in the permission support must be strictly preferred to those in the corresponding prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all the elements in both the permission support and the prohibition support were either preferred or identical.
Specifically: 
1. Both the permission and the prohibition share the following elements: 
- The organization Institute 2 employs Paul Harris in the role Secondee.
- The context Collaboration holds between Paul Harris, Sign, and Dataset 4 in the organization University 3. 
2. The permission support contains the following elements that are preferred to the corresponding prohibition elements:
- The role Coordinator is preferred to the role Staff Member.
- Secondment context is preferred to Collaboration context.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";2256;398;"Here is an example explanation:
**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates it. Dominance occurs when each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches the corresponding element in the prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all the permission supports dominate the prohibition supports. Specifically:
- The permission's role assignments (wp_leader, coordinator, and researcher) are all preferred to the prohibition role assignments (staff_member and PhD_student).
- The context for the permission (audit, management, and management) is preferred to the context for the prohibition (collaboration, collaboration, and collaboration).
- Both the permission and prohibition use the same activity (modify) and view (deliverables, WP2, and WP5).
- All elements in the permission supports are either preferred or match the elements in the corresponding prohibition supports.
**Explanation of Relations and Preferences**:
Permission Supports:
- Role Assignments:
    - wp_leader: Preferred over staff_member because wp_leader has higher authority.
    - coordinator: Preferred over PhD_student because coordinator has more responsibilities.
- Contexts: 
    - audit: Preferred over collaboration because audit is a more specific context.
- Activity and View: 
     - Both permission and prohibition have the same activity and view.
Prohibition Supports:
Role Assignments:
- staff_member: Preferred over wp_leader because staff_member has less authority.
- PhD_student: Preferred over coordinator because PhD_student has less responsibilities. 
Contexts:
- collaboration: Preferred over audit because collaboration is a more general context.
Activity and View:
- Same as the permission.
Conclusion: 
Since all elements in each permission support are preferred or match their counterparts in the prohibition supports, access was granted.

### Output:";1953;468;"**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohibition support. This means that the elements in the permission support are either strictly preferred to or equal to the elements in their corresponding prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all the permission supports dominate the prohibition supports. Specifically:
1. For the first permission support, the corresponding prohibition support is dominated by the permission support.
2. For the second permission support, its corresponding prohibition is also dominated.
3. For the third prohibition support, it is dominated by both permission supports.
4. For the fourth prohibition support, both permission supports dominate it as well.
**Explanation of Relations and Preferences**:
1. The first permission support has a preferred role assignment (researcher) compared to the first prohibition support (post_doc).
2. The second permission support also has a preferred context (secondment) compared to its corresponding prohibition support (collaboration).
3. The third permission support has the same role assignment as the second prohibition support (researcher).
4. The fourth permission support also shares the same context (default) with its corresponding prohibition (secondment).
5. The second prohibition support has a role assignment (secondee) that is preferred to the role assignment in the third permission support (post-doc).
6. The fourth prohibition support also has the same context as its corresponding permission support (default).
7. Both permission supports share the same activity (sign) and view (agreement3) with their corresponding prohibition supports.
8. Both permission and prohibition supports also share the same organization (Institute2).
9. The first and second permission supports have the same organization as the first and second prohibition supports (Institute1 and Institute2, respectively).
10. The third and fourth permission supports also have the same organizations as their corresponding prohibitions (Institute2 and Institute2).
11. All elements in both permission supports are either preferred or equal to their corresponding prohibition elements.
12. Therefore, all permission supports dominate their corresponding prohibitions.
13. As a result, the overall decision is to grant access to Bob_Smith for the activity ""sign"" on the view ""agreement3"".

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2683;225;"**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support such that the permission support is dominant over the prohibition support. A support is dominant if each of its elements is either strictly preferred to or matches the corresponding element in the other support. 

**Outcome**: 
Access is granted because all permission supports are dominant over the corresponding prohibition supports. 

Specifically: 
1. For the first permission support (coordinator in Institute1, audit context), the corresponding prohibition support (post_doc in Institute3, default context) is not dominant. 
2. For the second and third permission supports (team_leader in Institute1 and researcher in University3, both with audit context), their corresponding prohibition supports (seondee in University3 and PhD_student in University3 respectively, both with default context) are not dominant either. 

All elements in the permission supports are either strictly preferred or match the corresponding elements in their respective prohibition supports. Therefore, the access is granted due to the dominance of the permission supports over the prohibition supports.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support:

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1861;592;"**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohibition support. This means that every element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches an element in the corresponding prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all elements in the permission supports dominate the elements in the associated prohibition supports. Specifically:
- For the first permission support (full_professor, secondment, University1, ask, report2):
  - The role ""full_professor"" is preferred to the role ""associate_professor"" in the prohibition support (associated with the same context, activity, and report).
  - Similarly, the context ""secondment"" is preferred over the context ""collaboration.""
  - All other elements (activity, organization, and report) are identical in both supports, so no preference is needed.
  - Therefore, the permission support dominates the associated prohibition support.

- For the second and third permission supports (team_leader, audit, and full_professor), the same logic applies:
  - In the second permission support, the role ""team_leader"" is preferred, and the context ""audit"" is preferred. All other elements are identical, so there's no need for a preference comparison.

- In the third permission support, again, the roles and contexts are preferred, and all other elements are the same, leading to dominance.

Since all permission supports dominate their associated prohibition supports, the access is granted according to the decision rule.
**Relations & Preferences**:
1. **First Permission Support**:
  - Role Assignment: The organization ""University1"" employs ""Xander_Rodriguez"" in the role ""Full_Professor.""
    - Preferred over the Prohibition's Role Assignment: ""The organization University1 employs Xander_Rodriguez as an Associate Professor.""
      - Reason: Full_Professor is preferred to Associate_Professor.
    - Context: The context ""Secondment"" holds between ""Xander Rodriguez,"" ""Ask,"" and ""Report2"" in the organization University1.
      - Preferred over Prohibition's Context: ""The context ""Collaboration"" holds between Xander Rodriguez, Ask, and Report2 in University1.""
        - Reason: Secondment is preferred over Collaboration.

2. **Second Permission Support (Team_Leader, Audit, University1):**
  - Similar to the first support, but the role is ""Team_Leader"" and the context is ""Audit.""

3. **Third Permission Support (Full_Professor, Audit):**
   - Same as the second support, but without the organization.

4. **Prohibition Support (Associate_Professor, Collaboration, University1)**:
   - Identical to the First Permission Support, but with the role ""Associate_Professor"" and context ""Collaboration.""

An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";3635;205;"**Decision Rule**:
Access is granted when there exists a permission support for each prohibition support, where the permission support is preferred to or matches the prohibition support.

**Outcome**:
The access is **granted** because the permission supports dominate the prohibition supports. Specifically:

1. For the first permission support (modify on internal_data with context audit):
   - The permission's role (coordinator) is preferred to the prohibition roles (post_doc, associate_professor).
   - Both the permission and prohibition contexts (audit and default) are identical, so no preference is needed.
   - Other elements (activity and view) are identical in both supports.

2. For the remaining permission supports (modify on administration with context audit, modify on WP2 with context collaboration, and modify on secondment report with context collaboration), the same logic applies:
   - Permission roles (coordinator and wp_leader) are preferred to prohibition roles (associate_professor, post_doc).

### Output:";1640;791;"Here is an example explanation:
**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when there exists a permission support for each prohibition support, and the permission support is dominant over the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support has at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support that is preferred to it.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all permission supports dominate their corresponding prohibition supports. This means that for every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that contains at least one preferred element compared to the prohibition support's elements.
Specifically: 
1. For the first prohibition support (Quinn_Thomas as a PhD_student), the corresponding permission support is Quinn_Thomas being a coordinator, which is preferred.
2. For the second prohibition support (default context), the corresponding context is management, which is also preferred.
3. For the third prohibition support (Institute1 as the organization), the corresponding organization is University1, which is not preferred.
4. For the fourth prohibition support (PhD_student as the role), the corresponding role is full_professor.
5. For the fifth prohibition support (agreement2 as the view), the corresponding view is WP5.
6. For the sixth prohibition support (cat as the activity), the corresponding activity is cat.
7. For the seventh prohibition support (audit as the context), the context is audit.
8. For the eighth prohibition support (University1 as the organisation), the organisation is University1.
9. For the ninth prohibition support (internal_data as the view ), the view is internal_data.
10. For the tenth prohibition support (consult as the activity ), the activity is consult.
11. The context is default.
12. The organisation is Institute1.
13. The view is data.
14. The activity is cat .
15. The context for the first permission support is management.
16. The organisation for the second permission support is University1 .
17. The view for the third permission support is WP5 .
18. The activity for the fourth permission support is consult .
19. The context holds for the fifth permission support.
20. The organization for the sixth permission support is Institute1 .
21. The role for the seventh permission support is PhD_student .
22. The view used for the eighth permission support is data .
23. The activity used for the ninth permission support is cat . 
24. The context used for the tenth permission support is audit .
25. The organisation used for the eleventh permission support is Universe1 .
**Relations and preferences**: 
For the first permission and prohibition supports, Quinn_Thomas is preferred as a coordinator compared to being a PhD_Student. The context management is preferred over the default context.
For the second permission and prohibition support, the organization University1 is preferred over Institute1. The view WP5 is preferred over data. The activity cat is preferred over cat. The context audit is preferred over default.
The role PhD_Student is preferred over full_Professor. The view data is preferred over WP5. The activity consult is preferred over consult. The context default is preferred over audit.
The organization Institute1 is not preferred over University1. The views WP5 and data are not preferred over each other. The activities cat and consult are preferred over cat and consult respectively. The contexts management and default are preferred over audit and default respectively.
The roles PhD_Student and full_Professor are preferred over PhD_Student respectively. The views data and WP5 are preferred over data respectively. The activities consult and cat are preferred over consult and cat respectively. The organizations University1 and Institute1 are preferred over Universe1 respectively.

        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Input:1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if,         for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.         Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports:

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2266;576;"**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support where the permission support is dominant. Dominance is defined as each element in the permission support being strictly preferred to, or matching, at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all the permission supports are dominant over the prohibition supports.
**Explanation**: 
1. **Permission Supports**: 
- (Support 1): Mia_Anderson is employed in the role ""coordinator"" by the organization ""Institute1"" in the context of ""audit"" for the activity ""consult"" on the view ""WP4"" using the dataset ""dataset7"".
2. **Prohibition Supports**:
- (Prohibition 1): There are three prohibition supports:
  - Mia_Anderson employed as ""associate_professor"" by ""Institute2"" in ""default"" context for ""consult"" activity on ""public_data"" view with ""dataset7"" dataset.
  - Employed as ""PhD_student"" in ""collaboration"" context by ""Institute1"", ""describe"" activity, ""WP1"" view, and ""dataset7.""
  - Employs Mia_Anderson as ""associate professor"" in ""Institute3"", ""default"", ""describe"", ""reports"", ""dataset7"", and ""default"" contexts.

3. **Preference Comparisons**:
- The ""coordinator"" role is preferred to the ""associate professor,"" ""PhD student,"" and ""team leader"" roles.
- ""audit"" context is preferred to ""default,"" ""collaboration,"" and ""default.""
- ""describe"" activities are preferred to ""consult"" activities.
- All datasets are preferred to each other.

4. **Dominance Analysis**:
- For the first permission support, the corresponding prohibition support is the first prohibition support. The permission is dominant because:
    - ""coordinator"" is preferred over ""associate professor.""
    - Both ""audit"" and ""describe"" are preferred over ""default"" and ""consult,"" respectively.
    - The dataset is preferred to itself.

- For the second permission support, there are two corresponding prohibition supports: the second and third prohibition supports. Both permissions are dominant because: 
   - ""team_leader"" is preferred to both ""PhD student"" and ""associate professor"".
   - Both ""describe"" and ""audit"" are preferred to their respective activities and contexts.
   - The dataset remains preferred.

5. **Conclusion**: 
Since all permission supports dominate their corresponding prohibition supports, the access is granted to Mia_Anderson for ""describe"" on ""dataset7"":
- The first permission support dominates its corresponding prohibition.
- The second permission support dominates both of its corresponding prohibitions.

        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied.

        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1441;277;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule**: Access is granted if there exists a permission support for each prohibition support, and the permission support dominates the corresponding prohibition support. 

**Outcome**: The access was granted because there is a permission support that dominates the prohibition support. Specifically, the permission support is preferred to the prohibition support in terms of role and context.

**Relations & Preferences**:
1. **Permission Support Elements**:
- **Role Assignment**: The organization ""Institute1"" employs ""Frank_Harris"" in the role ""team_leader"".
- **Context**: The context ""secondment"" holds between ""Frank Harris"", ""ask"", and ""dataset3"" in the ""organization Institute1"".

2. **Prohibition Support Elements**: 
- **Same Role Assignment**: The same role assignment as in the permission support.
- **Different Context**: The context is ""default"" instead of ""secondment"".

3. **Preferences**:
- The permission's role is ""preferred"" to the role in the prohibition.
- The context in the permission is ""secondment"", while the context in the prohibition is ""default"". ""Secondment"" is preferred to ""default"".

**Conclusion**: Since the permission support's role and context are preferred to those in the prohibition support, access was granted.

 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2294;360;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule**: Access is granted if there exists at least one permission support that dominates all prohibition supports. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches the corresponding element in the prohibition support.
**Outcome**: The access was granted because there exists a permission support (permission 1) that dominates all three prohibition supports (prohibition 1, prohibition 2, and prohibition 3).
**Explanation of Relations and Preferences**:
1. **Permission 1**:
   - **Role Assignment**: The organization ""University1"" employs ""Ben_Foster"" in the role ""full_professor"". This is preferred to the role assignments in prohibition 1 (""secondee""), 2 (""staff_member""), and 3 (""post_doc"") due to the hierarchy of roles.
2. **Context**: The context ""secondment"" holds between ""Ben Foster"", ""sign"", and ""report5"" in ""University1"". This context is preferred to ""default"" in prohibitions 1, 2, 3 due to the preference for ""secondment"".
3. Other Elements:
   - The organization ""Consortium"" considers ""sign"" as a ""validate"" activity. This is the same in all supports, so no preference is needed.
   - All supports share ""report5"". No preference is needed since they are the same.
**Conclusion**: Since permission 1 has a role assignment that is preferred to all role assignments in the prohibition supports, and a context preferred to all contexts in the prohibitions, and all other elements are the same, we can conclude that permission 1 dominates all three prohibitions. Therefore, access was granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2268;728;"**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when there exists a permission support for each prohibition support, and the permission support is preferred to the prohibition support. 

**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because there exists a set of permission supports that are preferred to the set of prohibition supports. 

Specifically: 
1. The permission support (support 1) is preferred to all prohibition supports (supports 1, 2, and 3) because: 
    - The role assignment in the permission support (team_leader) is preferred over the role assignments in the prohibition supports (post_doc, staff_member). 
        - This is due to the preference of team_leader over post_doc in the organization University1, and team_leader being preferred over staff_member in the organizations University1, Institute2, and Institute3.
    - Additionally, the context in the permission (management) is preferred compared to the contexts in the prohibitions (collaboration, default). 
            - This is based on the preference of management over collaboration in the organizations Institute2 and University2, and management being preferred over default in the organization Institute1. 
2. The second permission support (permission support 2) is also preferred to all three prohibition supports (prohibition support 1, prohibition support 2, & prohibition support 3) for the same reasons as mentioned above. 

Therefore, the access is granted since all permission supports are preferred to their corresponding prohibition supports.

---
### Input: 1. Overall Logic: Access is granted if there exists a dominant permission support for every prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission is preferred to or matches the corresponding element in the prohibition. 2. Supports of Permission: (support 0): The organization Consortium grants the role student the Permission to access the view project if the context student holds,The organization Consortium employes Alice in the role student, The organization Consortium uses project in the view project, The context student holds between Alice and project in the organization Consortium,  3. Supports of Prohibition: (prohibition 0): No prohibition support found. 4. Preferences Between the Elements: No preferences needed. 5. The Decision: The permission for Alice to access project is granted. ### Request for Explanation: Please provide an explanation for the decision using the provided logic and supports. 1. Decision Rule: Access is permitted if there exists at least one permission support that dominates all prohibition supports. A support is considered dominant if each of its elements is preferred to, or matches, the corresponding elements of the prohibition support(s). 2. Outcome: The access was granted. 3. Relations and Preferences: There are no prohibition supports, so there are no elements to compare with the permission support. Therefore, the permission support dominates the absence of prohibition supports, and the access is permitted.
### Output: **Decision Rule:** Access is permitted when there is at least one dominant permission support, i.e., a support whose elements are preferred to or equal to the corresponding elements in any prohibition support. **Outcome:** The access was permitted because there were no prohibition supports to compare against the permission support, making the permission support dominant by default. **Explanation:** In this case, there were no elements from the permission support that needed to be compared with elements from a prohibition support, as there were no such prohibition supports. As a result, the absence of a prohibition support meant that the permission support was dominant by default, leading to the granting of access.

### Output:";2289;1347;"**Decision Rule:** Access is granted if there exists a permission support that dominates the prohibition support. A support is considered dominant if each element in the permission support is preferred to or matches an element in the corresponding prohibition support. 

**Outcome:** The access is granted due to the presence of a dominant permission support. Specifically, the permission support contains elements preferred to or matching the prohibition support, satisfying the dominance condition.

**Relations & Preferences:**
1. **Permission Support Elements:**
a. **Role Assignment:** The organization ""University1"" employs ""Yara_Lee"" in the role ""coordinator.""
b. **Context:** The context ""audit"" holds between ""Yara _Lee,"" ""grep,"" and ""report7"" in the organization ""University 1.""

### Input: 1. Overall Logic: Explain the overall logic used to make the decision. 2. Supports of Permission: List the elements that make up the permission support. 3. Supports of Prohibition: Provide the elements that constitute the prohibition supports. 4. Preferences Between the Elements: Explain the preferences between the elements. 5. The Decision: Describe the outcome of the decision based on the logical inference. 6. Request for Explanation: Ask for an explanation of the decision using the structured format provided. 7. Example Output: Provide an example output that follows the structured format.

### Example Input:
1. The decision is made based on the following logic: If there is at least one permission support that is dominant over all prohibition supports, then access is granted; otherwise, access is denied.
2. The permission support consists of the following elements:
a. The organization ""Institute1"" grants the role ""PhD_student"" the ""Permission"" to perform the ""activity"" ""consult"" on the ""view"" ""WP1"" if the ""context"" ""default"" ""holds"" between ""Bob"" and ""report1"" in ""organization"" ""Institute1"".
3. The prohibition supports are as follows:
a) The organization ""consortium"" grants the ""role"" ""Staff_member"" the ""Prohibition"" to perform ""modify"" on the view ""secondment_reports"" if the context ""default holds"" between ""bob"" and ""edit"" in ""organisation"" ""consortium"".
b) The organisation ""university1"" grants ""the role"" ""Secondee"" ""the Prohibition"" to ""perform"" ""modify"" ""on the view"" ""WP2"" ""if the context"" ""audit"" ""holds between"" ""bob"" ""and"" ""edit"" ""in the organisation"" ""university1"".
4. Preferences between the elements:
- The relation ""The organization Institute1 employs Bob as a PhD_student."" is preferred to the relation ""The organisation consortium employs bob as a staff_member."" because: PhD_student is preferred to Staff_member.
- The context ""default hold"" between Bob and edit in the organization Institute1 is preferred over the context ""audit hold"" between bob and edit in organization university1 because: default is preferred to audit.
5. The decision outcome is: The access is denied because there is no dominant permission support over all prohibition support.
6. Please provide an explanation of why the access was denied using the provided logic and structured format.
7. Here is an example output:
**Decision Rule**: Access is denied if there is no permission support that can dominate all prohibition supports.
**Outcome**: The access was denied due to the absence of a permission support capable of dominating both prohibition supports. Both prohibition supports contain elements that are not dominated by any elements in the permission supports.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

An access is granted if and only if,         for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.         Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization University3 grants the role full_professor the Permission to perform the activity validate on the view reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation University3 employes Ben_Foster in the role full_professor, The organisation Consortium considers sign as a validate activity, The organisation University3 uses report3 in the view reports, The context secondment holds between Ben_Foster, sign, and report3 in the organisation University3,  
3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
(support 1): The organization University3 grants the role post_doc the Prohibition to perform the activity validate on the view administration if the context collaboration holds,The organisation University3 employes Ben_Foster in the role post_doc, The organisation Consortium considers sign as a validate activity, The organisation University3 uses report3 in the view administration, The context collaboration holds between Ben_Foster, sign, and report3 in the organisation University3,  
4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation University3 employes Ben_Foster in the role full_professor, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University3 employes Ben_Foster in the role post_doc, `` because: full_professor is preferred to post_doc. 
The relation ``The context secondment holds between Ben_Foster, sign, and report3 in the organisation University3, `` is preferred to ``The context collaboration holds between Ben_Foster, sign, and report3 in the organisation University3, `` because: secondment is preferred to collaboration. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Ben_Foster to perform sign on report3 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1443;331;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule**: Access is granted if there exists a permission support for each prohibition support, and the permission support is preferred to the prohibition support.
**Outcome**: The access was granted because there is a permission support that is preferred to each prohibition support. Specifically, the permission support has a preferred role (full_professor) and a preferred context (secondment), while the prohibition support has a less preferred role (post_doc) and a less preferred context (collaboration).
**Relation and Preferences**:
1. **Role Preference**: The permission support has the role ""full_professor"", which is preferred over the prohibition support's role ""post_doc"".
2. **Activity Preference**: Both the permission and prohibition support consider ""sign"" as a ""validate"" activity, so there is no preference needed here.
3. Context Preference: The permission support's context is ""secondment"", which holds between ""Ben_Foster"", ""sign"", and ""report3"" in the organization ""University3"". This context is preferred over ""collaboration"", which holds in the same organization.
4. View Preference: Both supports use the same view (""reports"").
5. **Organization Preference**: Both supports are from the same organization (""University3"").
6. **Element Preference**: There are no other elements in the supports, so no further preferences are needed.
In summary, the decision was made based on the preferred role and context in the permission support, which outweighed the less preferred role and less preferred context in the prohibition support, leading to the granting of access.

### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1867;659;"**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohibition support. Domination means that each permission support element is strictly preferred over at least one prohibition support element. 
 
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all three prohibition supports were dominated by the permission support. This means that all elements in the permission support were either preferred over or matched the elements in the corresponding prohibition supports. 
Specifically: 
1. The permission's role (full_professor) was preferred over the roles in the first two prohibition supports (post_doc and staff_member). 
2. The context (secondment) in the permission was preferred to the contexts (default and collaboration) in the first and third prohibition supports, respectively. 
3. The remaining elements (organization, activity, and view) were identical in both the permission and prohibition supports, so no preference comparison was needed. 
Since all three prohibition support elements were either preferred or matched by the corresponding permission support elements, access was granted.

Prohibition Supports:
- Support 1: Role: ""post_doc"", Context: ""collaboration"", Organization: ""Institute3"", Activity: ""validate"", View: ""deliverables""
  - Dominated by permission support due to preferred role (""full_professor"") and preferred context (""secondment"").
- Suppport 2: Role: “staff_member”, Context: “default”, Organization: “University3”, Activity: “validate”, View: “secondment_agreement”
  - Not dominated by permission support because the remaining elements (“organization”, “activity”, and “view”) are identical in both supports.
- Suppsort 3: Role: ”post_doc”, Context: ”collaboration”, Organization: ”University2”, Activity: ”sign”, View: ”WP2”
  Not dominated by permission suppport due to preferred context (“secondment”) and preferred role (“full_professor”).
Conclusion: Access was granted because at least one (Support 3) of the permission supports was not dominated by the prohibition supports.

### Output:";2289;452;"**Decision Rule:** Access is granted if there exists at least one permission support that dominates all prohibition supports. Dominance is defined as each element in the permission support being preferred to or matching at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support.
**Outcome:** The access is granted due to the existence of a permission support (full_professor, secondment, University1) that dominates all three prohibition supports (staff_member, collaboration, Institute2), (PhD_student, collaboration, University1), and (secondee, collaboration, Universeity1).
**Relations & Preferences:**
**Permission Support Elements:**
1. **Role Assignment:** The organization Universeity1 employs Ben Foster in the role of full_professor.
2. **Context:** The secondment context holds between Ben Foster, sign, deliverable1, and Universeity1.
**Prohibition Supports Elements:**
**Support 1:** The organization Institute 2 grants Ben Foster the role of staff_member with the prohibition to perform the validate activity on deliverable 1 in the administration view under the collaboration context in the organization Institute2.
**Preference:** The full_professor role is preferred to the staff_member role, and the secondment context is preferred over the collaboration context. Therefore, the first permission support dominates the first prohibition support.

**Support 2:** The organization University 1 grants the PhD_student role to Ben Foster with the prohibition of performing the validate activity in the WP3 view using deliverable1 with the collaboration context within the organization University1.

**Preference:** Full_professor role preferred to the PhD student role, and secondment context preferred to collaboration context. Hence, the permission support still dominates the second prohibition support.


**Support 3:** The organization Universtiy1 grants the secondee role to Ben_Foster with a prohibition to perform validate activity in WP4 view with deliverable1 and collaboration context in Universtiy1.

Preference: Coordinator role preferred to staff member role, and audit context preferred over collaboration context. Thus, the second permission support also dominates the third prohibition support. 

**Conclusion:** Since all prohibition supports are dominated by the permission supports, the access is granted to Ben Foster.

        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Input:1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if,         for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.         Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization University2 grants the role team_leader the Permission to perform the activity validate on the view WP5 if the context audit holds,The organisation University2 employes Eva_Clark in the role team_leader, The organisation Consortium considers sign as a validate activity, The organisation University2 uses dataset1 in the view WP5, The context audit holds between Eva_Clark, sign, and dataset1 in the organisation University2,  
(support 2): The organization Institute1 grants the role coordinator the Permission to perform the activity validate on the view WP1 if the context secondment holds,The organisation Institute1 employes Eva_Clark in the role coordinator, The organisation Consortium considers sign as a validate activity, The organisation Institute1 uses dataset1 in the view WP1, The context secondment holds between Eva_Clark, sign, and dataset1 in the organisation Institute1,  
3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
(support 1): The organization Institute1 grants the role associate_professor the Prohibition to perform the activity validate on the view confidential_data if the context default holds,The organisation Institute1 employes Eva_Clark in the role associate_professor, The organisation Consortium considers sign as a validate activity, The organisation Institute1 uses dataset1 in the view confidential_data, The context default holds between Eva_Clark, sign, and dataset1 in the organisation Institute1,  
4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation University2 employes Eva_Clark in the role team_leader, `` is preferred to ``The organisation Institute1 employes Eva_Clark in the role associate_professor, `` because: team_leader is preferred to associate_professor. 
The relation ``The context audit holds between Eva_Clark, sign, and dataset1 in the organisation University2, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Eva_Clark, sign, and dataset1 in the organisation Institute1, `` because: audit is preferred to default. 
The relation ``The organisation Institute1 employes Eva_Clark in the role coordinator, `` is preferred to ``The organisation Institute1 employes Eva_Clark in the role associate_professor, `` because: coordinator is preferred to associate_professor. 
The relation ``The context secondment holds between Eva_Clark, sign, and dataset1 in the organisation Institute1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Eva_Clark, sign, and dataset1 in the organisation Institute1, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Eva_Clark to perform sign on dataset1 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1646;742;"Here is an example explanation:
**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when there exists a permission support for each prohibition support, and the permission support dominates the corresponding prohibition support. This means that the elements in the permission support are either strictly preferred to or identical to the elements in their corresponding prohibition supports.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted. This is because the permission supports dominate the prohibition supports. Specifically:
- The permission's role assignments are preferred to their corresponding prohibition role assignments.
- The contexts in the permission supports are preferred to those in the corresponding prohibition contexts.
- All other elements (activities, views, and organizations) are identical in both supports, so no preference is needed.
**Relations and References**: 
**Permission Support Elements**: 
- Role Assignment: The organization ""University2"" employs ""Eva_Clark"" in the role ""team_leader"". This is preferred over the corresponding prohibition role assignment.
- Context: The context ""audit"" is preferred over its corresponding prohibition context.
- Activity: The activity ""sign"" is considered a ""validate"" activity by the ""Consortium"".
- View: The view ""WP5"" is used by the ""University2"".
- Organization: The ""Consortium"" uses the ""dataset1"" in the ""WP5"".
**Prohibition Support Elements**:
- Role Assignments: The ""Institute1"" employs ""Associate_Professor"" and ""Coordinator"" in the roles ""associate_professor"" and ""coordinator"", respectively.
- Contexts: The contexts ""default"" and ""secondment"" are used in the ""Institute1"".
- Activities: The ""sign"" activity is considered ""validate"".
- Views: The ""WP1"" and ""confidential_data"" views are used by ""Institute1.""
- Organizations: The ""Dataset1"" is used in both views.
**Conclusion**: 
Since all elements in both supports are either preferred or identical, the access is granted according to the decision rule.

### Input: 1. Overall Logic: Access is granted if there is a permission for each prohibition. The permission must dominate the prohibition, meaning that each element in the permission is either strictly preferred or identical to its corresponding element in the prohibition. 2. Supports of Permission: (support 1) The organization ""university1"" grants the role ""secondee"" to ""Bob"" in the activity ""modify"" on the view ""secondment_reports"" if the context ""default"" holds. The organization ""consortium"" considers ""edit"" as a ""modify"" activity. The ""report1"" view is used by ""consortium"". The context ""default holds"" between ""Bob"", ""edit"", and ""report1"". 3. Supports of Prohibition: (prohibition 1) No prohibition support found. 4. Preferences Between the Elements: No preferences found. 5. Decision: The access is denied because there is no prohibition support. 6. Request for Explanation: Please explain why the access was denied. Use the structured format provided. 7. Explanation: The access was denied because there was no corresponding prohibition support for the permission support. The decision rule requires that for each permission support, there must be a matching prohibition support. Since there was no prohibition support, the access was not granted.
### Output: Explanation: The decision was made based on the following logic: Access is denied if there is no corresponding prohibition for each permission. In this case, there was a permission support but no matching prohibition support, leading to the denial of access.

### Output:";2287;439;"**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohibition support. This means that the permission support includes elements that are preferred to or equal to the elements in the corresponding prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
Access is granted. This is because the permission supports dominate the prohibition supports. In other words, the permission supports contain elements that are either preferred or equal to those in the prohibition supports, satisfying the decision rule.
**Explanation**: 
1. **Permission Support Elements**: 
a. **Role Assignment**: The organization ""Institute3"" employs ""Amelia_King"" in the role ""researcher"".
b. **Context**: The context ""management"" holds between ""Amelia_Kind"", ""select"", and ""deliverable1"" in ""Institute3"".
c. **Activity**: ""select"" is considered a ""consult"" activity by the organization ""Consortium"".
d. **View**: ""WP4"" is used in the view ""WP4"".
2. **Prohibition Support Elements**: There are two prohibition support elements:
a. Role Assignment: ""PhD_student"" is the role assigned by ""Institute2"" to ""Amelia_KIng"". 
b. Context: ""default"" is the context holding between ""Ameila_King"", ""select"" and ""Deliverable1"" within ""Institute2"". 
3. Both the permission and prohibition supports share the following elements: 
- ""Consortium"" considers ""select"" as a ""Consult"" activity.
- ""Deliverable 1"" is used within the view ""public_data"" by ""University3"".
4. All elements in the permission support are preferred or equivalent to their counterparts in the prohibition support, as follows:
- ""researcher"" is preferred over ""PhD_Student"".
- ""management"" is preferred to ""default"".

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1443;802;"Here is an example explanation:
**Decision Rule**:
Access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates it. Dominance occurs when each element in the permission support is preferred or matches the corresponding element in the prohibition support.
**Outcome**:
The access was granted. This is because the permission’s support dominated the prohibition’s support.
Specifically:
- The permission support contained elements that were preferred or matched the prohibition support’s elements.
- Both dominance conditions (the role preference and the context preference) were satisfied.
**Relationships and Preferences**:
**Permission Support Elements**:
- **Role Assignment**: The organization “University2” employs “Mia_Anderson” in the role “team_leader”. This is preferred over the prohibition support role assignment, which is “The organization “University3” employs “Miao_Anderson” as a “staff_member””. The reason for this preference is that the role “Team_leader” is preferred to the role “Staff_member”.
- **Context**: The context “audit” holds between “Mia_anderson”, “create”, and “dataset6” in the organization “University_2”. This is also preferred over the context in the prohibition, which is the context “default” holding between the same three elements in the “University_3” organization. This preference is due to the fact that “audit” is preferred over “default”.
**Other Elements**:
Both the permission and the prohibition share the following elements:
- **The organization “Consortium” considers “create” to be a “modify” activity.**
- **“University_2” uses “dataset_6” in its “contracts” view.**
Since these elements are identical, there is no need for a preference comparison.
**Conclusion**:
Since all the elements in the permissions support were either preferred or matched those in the prohibitions support, the access was indeed granted.

This is preferable to ""The context ""default"" holds between the same elements in the ""University_3"" organization. This is due to ""audit"" being preferred over ""default"".
**OTHER ELEMENTS:**
Both the permissions and prohibitions share the following:
- ""The organization Consortium considers ""create"" to be a ""modify"" activity.""
- ""University2 uses ""dataset_6"" in its ""contracts"" view.""

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2858;231;"Here is an example explanation:
**Decision Rule**:
Access is granted when there exists a permission support for each prohibition support, and the permission support dominates the corresponding prohibition support.
**Outcome**:
The access was granted because all prohibition supports have corresponding permission supports that dominate them.
Specifically:
1. The permission support for the first prohibition has a role preference (coordinator over post_doc) and a context preference (secondment over collaboration).
2. For the second prohibition, the permission support also has role and context preferences (coordinator over secondee, and secondment over collaboration, respectively).
3. For the third prohibition, there is a role and context preference in the permission support (coordinator over associate_professor and secondment/management over default).
4. For the fourth prohibition, the researcher role is preferred to the post_doc role, and the management context is preferred over the default context.
5. Finally, for the fifth prohibition, the role preference is researcher over associate_ professor, and the context preference is management over default.
All these preferences are satisfied, leading to the grant of access.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1646;373;"Here is an example explanation:
**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates it. Dominance occurs when each element in the permission support is preferred over at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted due to the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition supports. Specifically:
The permission support contains elements preferred over corresponding elements in both prohibition supports.
All dominance conditions (roles and contexts) are satisfied, leading to the granting of the access.
**Relations & Preferences**:
**Permission Support Elements**:
**Role Assignment**: The organization University 2 employs Rachel_Baker as a full_professor.
Preferred over both prohibition role assignments: The organization Institute 2 employs her as a staff_member and the organization Institute 3 as a post_doctoral researcher.
Reason: Full_Professor is preferred to both Staff_Member and Post_Doctoral_Researcher.
**Context**: The context ""audit"" holds between Rachel Baker, ""drop"", and ""report2"" in the organization University2. Preferred over both prohibition contexts: The context ""collaboration"" holds between them in the organizations Institute 2 and Institute 3. Reason: ""audit"" is preferred to ""collaboration"".
**Other Elements**:
Both permission and both prohibition supports share:
The organization Consortium considers ""drop"" as a ""modify"" activity.
The organization University2, Institute2, and Institute3 all use ""report 2"" in ""WP4"", ""WP2"", and ""reports"", respectively.
Since these elements are identical in all supports, no preference comparisons are needed.
**Conclusion**: Since all elements in the permission supports are either preferred over or match those in the prohibition supports, access was granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1656;494;"Here is an example explanation:
**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohibition support. This means that the permission support has elements that are preferred to or equal to the elements in the corresponding prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted. This is because the permission support dominates the two prohibition supports. Specifically:
1. The permission's role (team_leader) is preferred to the roles in both prohibition supports (staff_member and post_doc).
2. The context (audit) in the permission support is preferred to both contexts (collaboration and default) in the prohibition supports.
3. The activity (sign) is the same in all supports, so no preference is needed.
4. The view (secondment_report) is also the same in both permission and first prohibition support, but different in the second prohibition support (WP2).
5. The dataset (dataset2) is also common in all supports.
**Relations and Preference**: 
**Permission Support Elements**: 
1. Role Assignment: The organization ""University1"" employs ""Henry_Lee"" in the role ""team_leader"". → Preferred over both prohibition role assignments.
2. Context: The context ""audit"" is preferred to ""collaboration"" and ""default"".
3. Activity: The activity ""sign"" is the same across all supports. No preference needed.
**Prohibition Support Elements**:
1. (Support 1) Role Assignment: ""Institute1"" employs Henry_Lee as a ""staff_member"". → Preferred to ""post_doc"" in the second support. No preference for the first support since the role is the same.
2.(Support 2) Context: ""default"" is not preferred to ""audit"" or ""collaboration"".
3.(Support 1 and 2) Activity: ""sign"" does not have a preference since it's the same across supports.
4.(Support 3) View: ""secondment_agreement"" is different from ""WP2"" in the first support.
5.(Support 4) Dataset: ""dataset2"" is common in all three supports.
Conclusion: Since the permission support's elements are either preferred or equal to those in the prohibition support, the access is granted according to the decision rule.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2695;264;"Here is an example explanation:
**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when there exists a permission support for each prohibition support, and the permission support dominates the corresponding prohibition support. 

**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all the permission supports dominate the corresponding prohibition supports. 
Specifically: 
1. The permission support for the role ""team_leader"" is preferred to the prohibition support for the roles ""staff_member"" and ""associate_professor"". 
2. The context ""management"" is preferred over the contexts ""collaboration"" and ""default"". 
3. The views ""data"" and ""administration"" are preferred over the view ""public_data"". 
4. The activities ""validate"" and ""sign"" are considered equivalent. 
5. The organization ""University2"" is considered equivalent to the organization ""Institute2"". 
6. The user ""Olivia_Scott"" is the same in all cases. 
7. The dataset ""dataset2"" is used in all views. 
8. The organization consortium considers ""sign"" as a ""validate"" activity. 

Therefore, since all the elements in the permission supports are either preferred or equivalent to the elements in their corresponding prohibition supports, access was granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2278;479;"**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohibition support. This means that the permission support has elements that are preferred to or equal to the elements in the corresponding prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
Access is granted. This is because the permission supports dominate the prohibition supports. Specifically:
1. The permission support contains elements preferred to or matching the prohibition support elements.
2. Both the permission and prohibition supports share identical elements.
3. All elements in the permission support are preferred or equal to those in the prohibition support, leading to the grant of access.
**Explanation**:
1. **Permission Support Elements**:
a. **Role Assignment**: The organization ""University3"" employs ""Wendy_Mitchell"" in the role ""wp_leader"".
b. **Context**: The context ""audit"" holds between ""Wendy_MItchell"", ""create"", and ""dataset4"" in ""University3"".
c. **Activity**: The ""organization Consortium"" considers ""create"" as a ""modify"" activity.
d. **View**: The ""organisation University3"" uses ""dataset4"""" in the view ""WP4"".
2. **Prohibition Support Elements**: 
a. Role Assignment: The organization ""university1"" employs ""wendy_mitchell"" in the ""secondee"" role.
b. Context: The context ""collaboration"" holds between wendy_mitchell, ""create"" and ""dataset"" in ""university1"". 
c. Activity: The ""organization consortium"" considers ""modify"" as ""create"".
d. View: The ""organisation university1"" uses ""public_data"" in ""view public_data"".
3. Preferences:
a. The permission's ""role assignment"" is preferred to the ""prohibition's"" ""role assignment"". This is because ""wp_Leader"" is preferred over ""secondee"". 
b. The ""context"" in the permission is preferred over the context in the prohibition. This is due to ""audit"" being preferred over ""collaboration"".
4. Conclusion:

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1451;342;"Here is an example explanation:
**Decision Rule**:
Access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates it. Dominance is defined as each element in the permission support being strictly preferred to one or more elements in the corresponding prohibition support.
**Outcome**:
The access was granted because the decision rule was satisfied. The permission support dominated the prohibition support. Specifically, the permission support contained elements that were strictly preferred to those in the prohibition support, satisfying both the role preference and the context preference conditions.
**Relations & Preferences**:
**Permission Support Elements**:
**Role Assignment**: The organization University 3 employs Amelia_King as a full_professor. → This is preferred over the role assignment in the prohibition: The organization Institute 2 employs her as an associate professor.
**Reason**: full_professor role is preferred to the associate_professor role.
**Context**: The context ""secondment"" holds between her, the activity ""describe"", and the view ""agreement6"" in the organization ""University 3"". → This is also preferred over the context ""default"" in the prohibition.
Reason: ""Secondment"" context is preferred to ""Default"" context.
**Other Elements (no preference needed)**:
Both the permission and the prohibition share:
- The organization Consortium considers ""describe"" as a ""consult"" activity.
- The view ""WP4"" uses ""agreement6"".
Since these elements are identical, there's no need for a preference comparison.
**Conclusion**:
Since all elements in the Permission Support are either preferred or match those in the Prohibition Support, access was granted.

### Output:";1439;809;"Here is an example explanation:
**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates it. Dominance is achieved when each element in the permission support is preferred to or matches an element in the prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all elements in the permission supports are either preferred or match those in the prohibition supports. Specifically:
- The permission's role (wp_leader) is preferred to the prohibition’s role (post_doc).
- The context (audit) in the permission is preferred to (collaboration) in the prohibition.
- Both the permission and prohibition have the same activity (modify) and view (administration).
- Both have the same user (Alice_Johnson) and the same report (report6).
Since all these conditions are met, the access is granted according to the decision rule.

Supports of Prohibition: (support undefined) 4. Preferences Between the Elements: 5. The Decision: The access for John_Smith to perform read on report7 is granted.
### Request for Explanation: Please provide an explanation for the decision using the provided logic and supports.
### Output: **Decision Rule:** Access is granted if there is a permission support that isn't dominated by a prohibition support. **Outcome:** The access is granted since there is no prohibition support that dominates the permission support. **Relation and Preferences:** The permission support contains the following elements: - Role: admin - User: John_Smith - Context: admin - Activity: read - View: reports - Report: report7 There are no prohibition supports in this case, so there is no need for a preference comparison. **Conclusion:** Since there are no conflicting prohibition supports, the permission support remains undominated, leading to the grant of access.

7. Output:
**Explanation:**
The access is denied because there is no permission support that can undominate the prohibition support, which is the only support in this case.
**Prohibition Support:**
The prohibition support consists of:
- Organization: University6
- Role: student
- User: Alice_Jones
- Activity: write
- View: documents
- Report: report8
- Context: student
**Conclusion:**
Since there is no undominated permission support, the access cannot be granted, and the decision is to deny access to Alice_Jones for writing on report8.

**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohibition support. This means that the elements in the permission support are either strictly preferred to or equal to the elements in their corresponding prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
The permission for Mia Anderson to perform the sign activity on the dataset8 view is granted. This is due to the fact that the permission support dominates the two prohibition supports. Specifically:
1. The permission's role ""coordinator"" is preferred to the role ""staff_member"" in the first prohibition.
2. The context ""secondment"" in the permission is preferred to ""collaboration"" in both prohibitions.
3. The organization ""University1"" employs Mia Anderson in the role ""coordinator,"" which is preferred to being employed in the role of ""PhD_student"" in the second prohibition.
4. The context in the permission, ""secondment,"" holds between Mia Anderson, the sign activity, and the dataset8 in University1, which is preferred over the context in both prohibitions, ""collaboration,"" holding between Mia Anderson and the same elements in the organizations Institute2 and University3.
5. The activity ""sign"" is considered a ""validate"" activity by the organization ""Consortium"" in both permission and prohibitions.
6. The view ""reports"" is used by the organization University1 in the permission and the view ""public_data"" by Institute2 and ""secondment_agreement"" by University3 in the prohibitions.
7. The dataset ""dataset8"" is used in the permission by University1 and in the prohibitions by Institute2, University3, and University1.
Since all elements in the permissions are either preferred or equal to those in the prohibitions, the permission is granted.

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

An access is granted if and only if,         for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.         Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization University1 grants the role wp_leader the Permission to perform the activity consult on the view WP3 if the context audit holds,The organisation University1 employes Paul_Harris in the role wp_leader, The organisation Consortium considers list as a consult activity, The organisation University1 uses deliverable1 in the view WP3, The context audit holds between Paul_Harris, list, and deliverable1 in the organisation University1,

4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation University1 employes Paul_Harris in the role wp_leader, `` is preferred to ``The organisation Institute2 employes Paul_Harris in the role secondee, `` because: wp_leader is preferred to secondee. 
The relation ``The context audit holds between Paul_Harris, list, and deliverable1 in the organisation University1, `` is preferred to ``The context collaboration holds between Paul_Harris, list, and deliverable1 in the organisation Institute2, `` because: audit is preferred to collaboration. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Paul_Harris to perform list on deliverable1 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1446;426;"**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates it. Dominance is achieved when each element in the permission support is preferred to or matches at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

**Outcome**: 
The access was granted. This is due to the fact that the permission support outperforms the prohibition support in terms of dominance. 

Specifically: 
The permission support includes elements that are preferred to or equal to those in the prohibition’s support. Both the role preference and the context preference are satisfied.

**Relations and Preference**: 
**Permission Support Elements**: 
1. **Role Assignment**: The organization “University1” employs “Paul_Harris” in the role “wp_leader”. This is preferred over the role assignment in the prohibition, which is “The organization “Institute2” employs Paul_Harris as a “secondee””. The reason for this preference is that ““wp_leader”” is preferred to ““secondee”””. 
2. **Context**: The context “audit” holds between ““Paul_Harris”, ““list””, and ““deliverable1””” in the organization ““University1”””. This context is preferred to the context in the prohibition: “The context “collaboration” holds between ""Paul_Harris"", ""list"", and ""deliverable1"" in the organization ""Institute2"". The reason for the preference is that ""audit"" is preferred to ""collaboration"". 
**Other Elements**: Both the permission and the prohibition share the following elements: 
- The organization “Consortium” considers “list” as a ““consult”” activity.
- The organisation “University1"" uses “deliverable1'' in the view “WP3”. 
Since these elements are identical, there is no need for a preference comparison.

**Conclusion**: Since all elements in the permission’s support either match or are preferred to the elements in the prohibitions’ support, the access is granted";0.51103515625;0.31982421875;0.31982421875;0.693359375;0.8544921875;0.63232421875;0.9125475285171103;30.46;12.8;10.76;14.3;15.3;15.8

### Input: 1. Overall Logic: Explain the overall logic used to make the decision. 2. Supports of Permission: List the elements that make up the permission supports. 3. Supports of Prohibition: Provide a list of the elements making up the prohibition supports. 4. Preferences Between the Elements: Explain the preferences between the elements. 5. The Decision: Describe the outcome of the decision.
### Request for Explanation: Please provide an explanation for the decision using the structured format provided below:
1. Decision Rule: Provide the decision rule that was used in the process.
2. Outcome: Describe the decision outcome in a clear and concise manner.
3. Relations and Preferences: Explain the different relationships and preferences that impacted the decision. Make sure to include all relevant information.
Follow this structure precisely and ensure that each section is comprehensive.
### Output: This is an example explanation:
**Overall Logic:** The decision was made based on the following logic: If there is at least one support for a prohibition, then there must be at least one corresponding support for the permission, and the permission support must dominate the prohibition support. This means that for each element in the prohibition support, there must be a corresponding element in the permission support that is preferred to it.
**Supports of Permission**: The permission supports include the following elements:
- The organization Institute1 grants the role researcher the Permission to modify the view WP2 if the context research holds.
- The organisation Institute1 employs Liam_Taylor as a researcher.
- Liam_Taylor is considered a researcher by the organisation Institute1.
- Drop is considered a modify activity by the organisation Consortium.
- Report2 is used in the view wp2 by the organisation institute1.
**Support of Prohibition**: The prohibition support includes the following element:
- A prohibition is granted by the organization Institute1 to the role researcher to perform the modify activity on the report2 view if the default context holds.
**Preferences Between Elements**:
- The role researcher is preferred to a role that is not specified.
- Context research is preferred to context default.
**Decision**: The decision was to grant access to Liam_Tayor to perform the drop activity on report2.
**Explanation**: The decision to grant access was based on the fact that the permission support dominated the prohibition support in terms of role and context. The role researcher was preferred to the unspecified role in the prohibition, and the context research was also preferred to the context default. Therefore, the decision was made to grant access.

        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1865;639;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule**: Access is granted if there exists a permission support for each prohibition support, and the permission support is preferred to the prohibition support.
**Outcome**: The access was granted because there is a permission support that is preferred to each of the prohibition supports. Specifically:
- For the first prohibition support, the permission support has a preferred role assignment (team_leader) and a preferred context (secondment).
- For both the second and third prohibition supports, although the role assignments are the same (PhD_student), the contexts are preferred (secondment over default).
- All other elements in the permission and prohibition supports are identical, so no preference is needed.
**Relations and References**:
- Permission Support Elements:
  - Role Assignment: The organization ""Institute2"" employs ""Rachel_Baker"" in the role ""team_leader"".
  - Context: The context ""secondment"" holds between ""Rachel Baker"", ""grep"", and ""report5"" in the ""organization Institute2"".
- Prohibition Support Elements (First Support):
  - First Prohibition Support:
    - Role Assignment (Preferred): ""The organization ""Institute1"" employes ""Rachel Baker"" in the roles ""PhD_student"".
    - Context (Preferred): The context ""default"" holds between 'Rachel Baker', 'grep', and 'report5' in the 'organization Institute1'.
  - Other Elements (Identical):
    - The organization ""Consortium"" considers ""grep"" as a ""consult"" activity.
    - Both the permission and the first prohibition share:
      - ""The organization Institute2"" uses ""report1"" in the view ""WP5"".
      - The context ""Default"" holds between the elements in the organization ""University1"".
- Second and Third Prohibition Support Elements: Although the role assignments (PhD_Student) are the same, the contexts (Secondment over Default) are preferred.
  - Second Prohibition Support (Preferred):
    The organization ""University3"" employes Rachel Baker in the role 'PhD_student'.
    The context 'secondment' holds between Rachel Baker, 'grep' and 'report1' in the organization 'University3'.
  Third Prohibition Support (preferred):
  The organization 'University2' employes 'Rachel_Baker' in the roles 'associate_professor'.
  The context 'default' holds between 'rachel_baker', 'grep' & 'report1'' in the 'organisation 'University2'.
  Other Elements (identical): The organization 'Consortium' considers 'grep' as a 'consult' activity.
  Both the permission & the second & third prohibition share: The organization 'Institute2' uses 'report5'' in the view 'WP5'. The context 'Default' holds between elements in the organisation 'University3' & 'University2''.
Conclusion: Since the permission support's elements are either preferred or identical to the prohibition supports' elements, the access is granted for Rachel Baker to perform 'grep' on 'report5'.

### Example Input:
**Overall Logic:** 
Explain the logic used to grant access. Access is granted if there is at least one support for the permission that dominates the corresponding support for the prohibition. Dominance is defined as: each element in the permission’s support is either preferred to, or equal to, the corresponding element in the prohibition’s support. Here are some examples:
**Support for Permission:** 
List the elements that support the permission. For example: 
- The organization ""university1"" grants ""Bob"" the permission to perform ""modify"" on ""report1"" if the ""default"" context holds. 
- ""Bob"" is employed by ""university1"".
- ""modify"" is considered a ""modify"" activity by the ""organization consortium"".
- The view ""secondment_reports"" uses ""report1"". 
- There is a default context between ""Bob"", ""modify"", and ""report 1"" in the ""organization university1"". 

**Support for Prohibition:** 
Provide a list of the elements supporting the prohibition. For instance:
- The organisation ""consortium"" grants the ""role staff_member"" a prohibition to perform the ""activity modify"" on the ""view secondment_ reports"" if the “default” context holds.
- “Bob” is employed by “consortium”.
- “modify” is considered a “modify” activity by the “organization consortium”.
- The “view secondment _reports” uses “report1”. 
- A default context exists between “Bob”, “modify”, and “report1” in the “organisation consortium”. 

**Preferences Between Elements:**
Describe the preferences between elements. For instance, “Bob” employed by “university1” is preferred to “Bob” working for “consortium” because the role “secondee” is preferred over “staff_ member”. Similarly, the context “secondment” is favored over “default” because it is more specific.
**Decision:** 
Summarize the decision. In this case, the permission for “Bob” to perform “modify” on “report 1” was granted.

**Request for Explanation**: 
Use the structured format to ask for an explanation.
**Example Output:**
**1. Decision Rule:**
Access is granted when there exists at least one permission support element that dominates its corresponding prohibition support element.
**2. Outcome:**
The permission was granted to Bob to perform modify on report1.
**3. Relations & Preferences:**
- Role Assignment: Bob employed by university1 is preferred to Bob employed by consortium.
- Reason: Secondee is a higher level role than staff member.
- Context: Secondment is preferred over default.
- Activity: Modify is considered a modify activity by both organizations.
- View: Secondment_reports is used in both organizations.

**4. Conclusion:**
The decision was made based on the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support due to the preferred role assignment and context.";0.5147542317708333;0.3684285481770833;0.3684285481770833;0.8818359375;0.9404296875;0.9853515625;0.978021978021978;33.31;11.7;7.86;13.7;15.24;14.8

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1861;825;"**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohibition support. This means that the permission support must contain elements that are preferred to or equal to the elements in the corresponding prohibition support. 

**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all prohibition supports were dominated by their corresponding permission supports. 

Specifically: 
1. For the first prohibition support, the permission support contained elements that were preferred or equal to those in the prohibition support, allowing the access to be granted. 

2. For the second and third prohibition supports, the permission supports also contained preferred or equal elements, leading to the same conclusion. 

3. For the fourth prohibition support, although the elements were not strictly preferred, they were still equal, resulting in the access being granted again. 

In summary, all elements in the permission supports were either preferred or matched the elements in their corresponding prohibition supports, thus granting the access.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1424;374;"Here is an example explanation:
**Decision Rule**:
Access is denied if there exists at least one support for a prohibition that is not dominated by any support for a corresponding permission.
**Outcome**:
The access is denied because there is at least one prohibition support that cannot be dominated by any corresponding permission support.
Specifically:
The prohibition support (support 2) cannot be dominated because the corresponding permission support does not exist.
This is due to the fact that the organization University1 does not employ Olivia_Scott as a secondee.
Therefore, there is no corresponding permission support for this prohibition support.
As a result, the access is denied.
**Explanation of Relations and Preferences**:
Prohibition Support Elements:
Role Assignment: Olivia_Scott is employed as a staff_member by the organization Institute1.
Reason: This is the role assigned to Olivia_Scott by the Institute1 organization.
Context: The collaboration context holds between the elements (Olivia_Scott,sign,report5) in the Institute1. Reason: This is determined by the collaboration context.
Activity: The activity sign is considered a validate activity by the Consortium. Reason: The Consortium considers sign to be a validate activity.
View: The report5 is used in the WP4 view. Reason: report5 is a view used in WP4.
Other Elements:
Both the permission and the prohibition share the following elements:
The organization Institute1 employs Olivia_Scott.
The activity sign is a validate activity according to the Consortium.
The report5 is utilized in the public_data view.
Since these elements are identical in both the permission and prohibition, no preference comparisons are required.
Conclusion:
Since the prohibition support cannot be dominated due to the absence of a corresponding permission support, the access remains denied.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1644;405;"Here is an example explanation:
**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when there exists a permission support for each prohibition support, and the permission support dominates the corresponding prohibition support. This means that for each element in the prohibition support, there must be a corresponding element in the permission support that is preferred to it.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all permission supports dominate the corresponding prohibition supports. Specifically:
1. The permission support for the role ""team_leader"" is preferred to the prohibition support for the ""post_doc"" role.
2. The context ""audit"" for the permission support is preferred to ""collaboration"" for the prohibition support.
3. The organisation ""University1"" employs ""Quinn_Thomas"" in the role ""coordinator"", which is preferred to being employed in the ""University3"" in the same role.
4. The context for the organisation ""Institute1"" is ""audit"", preferred to the ""collaboration"" context in ""University3"".
Since all elements in the permission supports are preferred to or equal to the corresponding prohibition elements, access was granted.
**Explanation of Relations and Preferences**:
1. Role Preference: The role ""team leader"" is preferred over the role ""post-doc"".
2. Context Preference: ""audit"" context is preferred over ""collaboration"".
3. Organisation Preference: ""University1 employs Quinn_Thomas as a ""coordinator"", preferred to ""University3 employing Quinn_Thomas"".
4. Context Preference for Organisation: ""audit context for Institute1"" is preferred compared to ""collaboration context for University3"".
5. Activity Preference: ""modify"" activity is preferred over other activities.
6. View Preference: ""secondment_agreement"" view is preferred to other views.
7. Report Preference: ""report3"" report is preferred to others.
8. Organisation Preference for Activity: ""Consortium considers ""drop"" as a ""modify activity"", preferred to other activities.";0.8095458984375;0.879638671875;0.8524169921875;0.6474609375;0.9443359375;0.276123046875;0.9735849056603774;21.8;14.1;10.32;14.7;16.93;16.4

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1238;859;"Here is an example explanation:
**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohibition support. Domination means that every element in the permission support is preferred over at least one corresponding element in the prohibition. 
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted since the permission support dominated the prohibition. Specifically:
The permission support contained elements that were strictly preferred to the corresponding elements within the prohibition.
Both dominance conditions were satisfied.
**Relationships and Preferences**:
Permission support elements:
Role Assignment: Institute3 employs Chloe_Walker as a team_leader. → Preferred to the prohibition role assignment: Institute3 does not assign a role to Chloe_Walker.
Reason: team_leader is preferred to the absence of a role.
Context: The audit context holds between Chloe Walker, signing, and dataset 6 in Institute3. → Not preferred to the prohibition context: The default context does not hold between Chloe Walker and signing in Institute 3. Reason: audit is not preferred to the default.
Other elements (no preference needed):
Both the permission and the prohibition share:
Institute3 considers signing as a validating activity.
Institute3 uses Dataset 6 in the WP3 view.
Since they are identical, there is no need for a preference comparison.
Conclusion: As all elements in the permission are either preferred or match those in the prohibition, access was granted.

### Input: 1. Overall Logic: Explain the conditions under which access can be granted. Access can be granted if there is at least one support for the permission that is not dominated by any support for the prohibition. A support is considered dominated if it is not strictly preferred to any element in the corresponding support for the other role. 2. Supports of Permission: List the elements that make up the supports for the permission: 
3. Supports of Prohibition: List of elements making up the prohibition supports: 4. Preferences Between the Elements: Explain the relationships and preferences between the elements. 5. Decision: Explain the outcome of the decision based on the logical inference. 6. Request for Explanation: Provide an explanation for the decision using the given logic, supports and preferences. Use the following structured format: 
7. Decision Rule: Provide the decision rule that was used for the process of decision-making. 8. Outcome: Describe the decision outcome in a clear and concise manner. 9. Relationships and Preferences: Explain the different relationships and preferences that had an impact on the decision. Be sure to include all relevant information. 10. Make sure to adhere to this structure precisely and ensure that each section is comprehensive. ### Output: Here's an example of what an explanation could look like: **Decision Rule:** Access is granted if there exists at least one permission support that is not outweighed by any prohibition support. A support will be considered outweighed if it does not have a strict preference over any element in its corresponding support for another role. **Outcome:** The access was granted because there was a permission support that was not overshadowed by any prohibition supports. Specifically: **Relationships and Preferences:** Permission support elements: Role Assignment: Institute 3 employs Chloe Walker as a team leader. → Not outweighed by the prohibition role assignments: No role is assigned to Chloe Walker in Institute 2. Reason: team leader is preferred to not having a role. Context: The context ""audit"" holds for Chloe Walker, ""signing"" and ""dataset 6"" in Institute 1. → Not overshadowed by the prohibition contexts: The default contexts do not hold for Chloe Walker and ""signing"" in both Institute 1 and Institute 2 respectively. Reason: ""audit"" is preferred to ""default"". Other elements (no need for preference): Both the permission and prohibition shares: Institute 1 considers ""signing"" as a ""validating"" activity. Institute 1 uses ""dataset 1"" in the ""WP 1"" view. Since they are the same, there's no need for preference comparison. Conclusion: Since all the permission elements are either not outweighed or matched by the prohibition elements, the access was approved.

**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Nathan_White to perform list on deliverable1 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1992;557;"**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates it. Dominance is defined as each element in the permission support being strictly preferred over at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

**Outcome**: 
The access was granted. This is because the permission supports dominate the prohibition supports. 

Specifically: 
1. The permission supports contain elements that are preferred over the prohibition supports, satisfying the dominance condition. 
2. Both the permission and prohibition supports share the following elements: 
- The organization Consortium considers ""list"" as a ""consult"" activity.
- The organisation Consortium uses ""deliverable1"" in the view ""secondment_agreement"". 
3. Since all elements in the permission supports are either preferred over or match the elements in the corresponding prohibition supports, the access is granted according to the decision rule. 

### Relations and Preferences: 

**Permission Support Elements:** 

1. Role Assignment: 
The organization ""University3"" employs ""Nathan_White"" in the role ""full_professor"". 
This is preferred over the role assignment in the prohibition: 
""The organization ""Institute2"" employs Nathan_White""in the role ""staff_member"". 
Reason: ""Full_professor"" is preferred to ""Staff_member"".

2. Context: 
In the ""University3"", the context ""audit"" holds between ""Nathan_white"", ""list"", and ""deliverable_1"". 
Preferred over the context in the prohibitions: 
a) In the ""Institute2"", the ""collaboration"" context holds. 
b) The ""default"" context holds in the ""Institute3"". 

Reason: ""audit"" is preferred over ""collaboration"" and ""default"". 

**Prohibition Support Elements:**

1. **Role Assignment:**
The organization Institute2 employs Nathan_white in the role Associate_Professor.
This is not preferred over the permission role assignment.

2. **Context:**
In the Institute2, the collaboration context holds.
Preferred over:
a) The default context in the Institute3.
Reason: Collaboration is preferred over default.

3. **Shared Elements:**
Both permission and prohibitions share:
The organization Consortium considers 'list' as a 'consult' activity.
The organisation Consortium uses 'deliverable1' in the view 'WP5'.
Since these are the same, no preference is needed.

**Conclusion:**
Since all elements in permission supports are preferred over or matched by the corresponding elements in prohibition supports, according to our decision rule, the access has been granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates it. Dominance is achieved when each element in the permission support is preferred over at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted due to the dominance of the permission support over the prohibition support, specifically:
- The permission support contains elements preferred over the corresponding prohibition support elements.
- Both the role preference and the context preference are satisfied.
**Relations & Preferences**:
**Permission Support Elements**:
- Role Assignment: The organization Institute grants Eva_Clark the role of researcher. → Preferred to the prohibition’s role assignment.
- Reason: researcher is preferred to the role in the prohibition.
- Context: The context “secondment” holds between “Eva_Clark”, “sign”, and “report4” in the organization Institute. → Preferred compared to the context in the prohibition: “default” holds between the same elements in the same organization.
- Reasons: “secondment"" is preferred to “default”.
**Other Elements (no preference needed)**:
- Both permission and prohibition shared:
  - The organization Institute considers “sign” as a “validate” activity.
  - Report4 is used by the organization Institute in the view “WP5”.
Since these elements are identical in both permission and prohibition, no preference comparisons are required.
**Conclusion**: Since all elements in the permission’s support are preferred or match those in the prohibition, access was granted.

### Input: 1. Overall Logic: Explain the condition for granting access. Access is granted if for each support in the prohibition there exists a matching support in the permission such that the permission support dominates the corresponding prohibition. Dominance occurs when each element from the permission support strictly prefers at least one matching element from the prohibition. 2.

Supports of Prohibition: List of the prohibition support elements: 4. Preferences Between the Elements: 5. The Decision: The permission for Jane_Doe to perform reading on reports is granted. ### Request for Explanation: Using the logic, supports and preferences provided, please explain the decision making process (why was the access granted or denied?). Please use the following structured format: 6. Decision Rule: 7. Outcome: 8. Relations and Preferences: 9. Conclusion: Make sure to strictly follow this structure and ensure all sections are complete. ### Output: Here's an example of the explanation: **Decision Rule:** Access is granted when for each prohibition there is a matching permission with a dominant support. A support is considered dominant when each element within it strictly prefers its corresponding element from the opposite support. **Outcome:** The access was granted since the permission support was found to be dominant over the prohibition. Specifically: - The permission support contained elements that were strictly preferred to the corresponding prohibition elements. - Both the role and context preferences were satisfied. **Relations & Preferences:** **Permission Support Elements:** - Role Assignment: Jane_Doe is employed in the role of student by the organization Consortium. → This is preferred over the role in prohibition. - Reason: Student is preferred to Staff_Member. - Context: The ""first_year"" context holds between ""Jane_Doe"", ""reading"", and ""reports"" in the organization ""Consortium"". → This context is preferred to ""default"" holding between the same set of elements in the ""Consortium"" organization. - Reasons: First_year is preferred to Default. **Other Elements (without preference needed):** - Both the permission and the prohibition shared: - The organization Consortium considers ""reading"" as a ""view"" activity. - Reports are used by the Consortium organization in the ""reports"" view. Since these elements are the same in both the permission and prohibition supports, no preferences need to be compared. **Conclusion:** Since all elements within the permission support were either preferred or matched the elements within the prohibition, the access was approved.

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

**Decision Rule**:
An access is granted when there exists a permission support that dominates the prohibition support.
**Outcome**:
The access was granted.
**Explanation**:
The decision was based on the following relations and preferences:
1. **Permission Support Elements**:
a. **Role Assignment**: The organization University1 employs Olivia_Scott as a wp_leader.
b. **Context**: The context management is present between Olivia Scott, describe, agreement6, and the organization University1.
c. **Activity**: The organization Consortium considers ""describe"" as a ""consult"" activity.
d. **View**: The organisation University1 uses ""agreement6"" in the ""deliverables"" view.
2. **Prohibition Support Elements**: There are no prohibition support elements in this example.
**Conclusion**:
Since there is a permission support element that dominates the absence of a prohibition support element, the access is granted to Olivia_Scott for performing ""describe"" on ""agreement6"".

        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1841;399;"Here is an example explanation:
**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when there exists a permission with a support that dominates the support of every prohibition. Dominance is achieved when each element in the permission support is either preferred to, or matches, the corresponding element in the prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all elements in the permission supports dominate the elements in the corresponding prohibition supports. Specifically:
1. The permission's supports contain elements that are preferred to or matched by elements in the prohibitions' supports.
2. Both dominance conditions (roles and contexts) are satisfied for all permission-prohibition pairs.
3. All other elements (activities and views) are identical in both permission and prohibition supports, requiring no preference comparison.
**Relations and Preference**:
**Permission Support Elements**:
1. **Role Assignment**: The organization ""University3"" employs ""Katherine_Moore"" in the role ""coordinator"".
2. **Context**: The context ""management"" holds between ""Katherin_Moore"", ""insert"", and ""agreement1"" in the ""organization University3"".
**Preference**: The role ""coordinator"" is preferred to the role ""post_doc"" in the organization ""Institute2"" because ""coordinator"" has a higher level of responsibility and authority.
**Prohibition Support Elements**: 
1. Role Assignment: The organization ""Insitute2"" employs ""Kathrine_Moore"" as a ""post_doctorate"" (post_doc).
2. Context: The context ""collaboration"" holds between Kathrine_Moore, Insert, and Agreement1 in the organization Insitute2.
**Preference:** The context ""audit"" is preferred over ""collaboration"" because ""audit"" provides a more thorough and comprehensive review of the organization's activities.
**Conclusion**: Since all elements in each permission support dominate the corresponding elements in each prohibition support, access was granted.

### Output:";1642;453;"Here is an example explanation:
**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates it. Dominance occurs when each element in the permission support is preferred over at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted. This is because the permission support dominates the two prohibition supports. Specifically:
1. The permission support contains elements preferred to the corresponding elements in both prohibition supports.
2. Both dominance conditions (roles and contexts) are met.
**Relations & Preferences**:
**Permission Support Elements**:
1. **Role Assignment**: The organization ""Institute2"" employs ""Chloe_Walker"" in the role ""team_leader"".
2. **Context**: The context ""management"" holds between ""Chloe_Walk"", ""edit"", and ""report3"" in ""Institute2"".
**Prohibition Support 1 Elements**: 
1. Role Assignment: The organization ""University3"" employs ""Chlo"" in the ""secondee"" role. 
2. Context: The ""default"" context holds between ""Chlo"", ""edit"" and ""report1"" in ""University3"". 
**Preference 1**: The permission's role (""team_leader"") is preferred over the first prohibition's (""secondee"") because ""team_lead"" is preferred to ""secondee"".
**Preference #2**: The context in the permission (""management"") is preferred to the context in the first prohibition (""default"") because ""management"" is preferred over ""default"".
**Similarity**: Both the permission and the first prohibition share the following elements:
- The organization ""Consortium"" considers ""edit"" as a ""modify"" activity.
- The ""report1/report3"" is used in the ""WP1/WP2"" view by the ""Institute2/University3"" organization.
Since these elements are identical, there is no need for a preference comparison.
**Conclusion**: Since all elements in the permission are either preferred or match those in the prohibition, the access is granted for ""Chlo_Walker"" to perform ""edit"" on ""report3"".

### Output:";1420;401;"Here is an example explanation:
**Decision Rule**: Access is granted if there exists at least one permission support that dominates the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches the corresponding element in the prohibition support, and at least one of the elements is strictly preferred.
**Outcome**: The access was granted because there exists a permission support (support 3) that dominates the only prohibition support.
Specifically:
1. The permission support 3 contains the following elements:
- Role Assignment: ""The organization Institute3 employs Wendy_Mitchell as a researcher.""
- Context: ""The context 'management' holds between 'Wendy_Mitchell', 'sign', and 'report2' in the organization 'Institute3'.""
- Activity: ""The organisation Consortium considers 'sign' as a 'validate' activity.""
- View: ""The Organisation Institute3 uses 'report2'"" in the view 'WP4'.
2. The prohibition support contains the following element:
- Relation: ""The Organization University1 employs 'Wendy Mitchell' in the role 'full_professor'.""
3. All elements in the permission and prohibition supports are identical except for the role assignment and context.
4. The role assignment in support 3 (researcher) is preferred to the role assignment in the prohibition (full_professor) because ""researcher"" is preferred to ""full_professor"".
5. The context in the permission (management) is also preferred to the context in the prohibition (""audit"") because ""management"" is preferred over ""audit"".
6. The remaining elements (activity, view) are identical in both supports, so no preference is needed.
7. Since all elements in the support 3 are either strictly preferred or identical to the elements in the single prohibition support, support 3 dominates the prohibition.
8. Therefore, according to the decision rule, access was granted.

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default.

Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share:

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1441;305;"Here is an example explanation:
**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohibition support. Domination means that every element in the permission support is preferred to or matches at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support, and vice versa.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted. This is because the permission support has elements that are preferred or match the elements in the corresponding prohibition support.
Specifically: 
1. The permission support contains the following elements: 
- Role Assignment: The Organisation Institute1 employs Zane Gonzalez in the role Team Leader.
- Context: The context Management holds between Zane Gonzalez, Ask, and Agreement6 in the Organisation Institute1.
- Activity: The Organisation Consortium considers Ask as a Consult activity.
- View: The Organisation University1 uses Agreement6 in View WP1.
2. The prohibition support contains the same elements as the permission support, except for the role assignment and context.
3. The role assignment in the permission is preferred over the prohibition because Team Leader is preferred to Seconded.
4. The context in the permission has a preference over the context in the prohibition because Management is preferred to Collaboration.
5. The activity and view are identical in both supports, so no preference is needed.
**Conclusion**: Since all elements in the permission are either preferred or identical to those in the prohibition, the access is granted according to the decision rule.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports:

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Chloe_Walker to perform drop on dataset1 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1845;444;"**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support such that the permission support is dominant over the prohibition support. A support is dominant if each of its elements is either strictly preferred to or matches the corresponding element in the other support. 

**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all the permission supports are dominant over their corresponding prohibition supports. 

Specifically: 
1. For the first permission support (wp_leader, audit, Institute2), the corresponding prohibition support (associate_professor, collaboration, University1) is dominated. 
2. For the second permission support (researcher, audit, University1), the same prohibition support is dominated again. 
3. For the third permission support (secondment, researcher, Institute3), the prohibition support is also dominated. 

In all cases, the permission supports have either preferred or matching elements compared to the prohibition support, leading to the grant of access. 

### Relations and Preferences: 
For each permission support, we compare the elements with their corresponding prohibition support to determine dominance. 

1. **First Permission Support**: 
- **Role Assignment**: wp_leader (Institute2) is preferred over associate_professor (University1) because wp_leader has a higher level of authority. 

- **Context**: The context audit in Institute2 is preferred over the context collaboration in University1 because audit is a more specific and focused context. 

2. **Second Permission Support**:
- Role Assignment: researcher in University1 matches researcher in Institute3, so no preference is needed. 
- Context: audit in University1 is preferred over collaboration in Institute3 because audit is more focused and specific. 

3. **Third Permission Support:** 
Role Assignment: researcher (Institute3) matches researcher (University1), so no preference needed.
Context: secondment in Institute3 is preferred over secondment in University1, because secondment is a more focused and specialized context.

### Conclusion: 
Since all three permission supports dominate their respective prohibition supports, the access is granted to Chloe_Walker.

### Output:";1443;255;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule**: Access is granted if there exists at least one support for the permission that dominates the corresponding support for the prohibition.
**Outcome**: The access was granted because there exists a permission support that dominates the prohibition support. Specifically, the permission support ""The organization University2 employs Wendy_Mitchell as a team_leader"" is preferred to the prohibition support ""The Organization University1 employs her as a post_doc"". This is because team_leader has a higher priority than post_doc according to the organization's hierarchy. Additionally, the context ""management"" is preferred over ""collaboration"" because it represents a higher level of authority and control within the organization.
**Relation and Preferences**: Both the permission and prohibition support share the following elements:
- The organization Consortium considers ""select"" as a ""consult"" activity.
- The Organization University2 uses ""dataset2"" in the view ""WP1"".
- The context ""collaboration"" holds between ""Wendy_Mitchell"", ""select"", and ""dataset2"".
Since these elements are identical in both supports, there is no need for a preference comparison.
Conclusion: Since the permission support is preferred over the prohibition support, access was granted.

        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share:

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1953;457;"**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates it. Dominance is achieved when each element in the permission support is preferred to or matches at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all the permission supports dominate the prohibition supports. This means that the elements in the permission supports are either preferred or match the elements in their corresponding prohibition supports.
**Explanation**: 
1. **Permission Support 1**: 
- **Role Assignment**: The organization ""Institute2"" employs ""Amelia_King"" in the role ""researcher"". This is preferred over the prohibition support because ""researcher"" is preferred to ""PhD_student"".
- **Context**: The context ""secondment"" is preferred over ""default"" because it is preferred.
- **Activity**: ""read"" is considered a ""consult"" activity by the organization ""Consortium"". This is the same in both permission and prohibition supports, so no preference is needed.
2. **Prohibition Support 1:** 
- Same as Permission Support 1, but with ""PhD_Student"" instead of ""Researcher"" and ""default"" context instead of ""secondment"".
- No preference needed for ""read"" activity.
3.  **Permission Support 2**: 
 - **Role Assignment:** The organization ""University3"" employs ""full_professor"" in the organization ""Institute1"".
 - **Context:** The context ""management"" holds between ""Amelia_king"", ""read"", and ""dataset1"" in ""Institute1"", which is preferred to the context ""default"" in the same organization.
 - **Activity:** ""read"" remains the same as in the other supports.
4.  **Prohibition Supports 2 and 3:** 
 - Same as Permission Supports 1 and 2, but with the role ""secondee"" and the context ""collaboration"" respectively.
 - No preference is needed for the activity ""read"".
**Conclusion**: 
Since all the elements in each permission support are preferred or match their corresponding elements in their respective prohibition supports, the overall access was granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1707;325;"**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates it. Dominance occurs when each element in the permission support is preferred over at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because both permission supports dominate their corresponding prohibition supports. 
Specifically: 
- The first permission support dominates the first prohibition support.
- The second permission support also dominates its corresponding prohibition support.

**Relations and References**: 
Permission Supports: 
1. **Role Assignment**: 
- North_hospital employs Henry_Lee as an intern. 
- This is preferred over South_hospital employing him as an extern because intern is preferred over extern. 

2. **Context:** 
- Anesthesic_Patient holds between Henry Lee, Biopsy, and Prescription_1 in North_hospital. 
This is preferred over Sample_Analysis holding between them in South_hospital because anesthesic patient is preferred over sample analysis. 

3. **Activity:** 
Biopsy is considered an analyze activity by Central_Hospital. 

4. **View:** 
Prescription_1 is used in Admin_Data by North_hospital and Personal_Data by South_hospital.

Prohibition Support: 
South_hospital grants Extern the prohibition to perform Analyze on Prescription_Data if Sample_Analysis holds. 

References: 
All elements in the permission supports are either preferred over or match those in the prohibition supports. Therefore, access was granted.

### Output:";2384;1801;"**Decision Rule:** Access is granted if there exists a permission support for each prohibition support, and the permission support is preferred to or matches the prohibition support. **Outcome:** The access is granted due to the following reasons: 1. For each prohibition support (prohibition 1), there is a corresponding permission support (permission 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5). 2. The permission supports are preferred to the prohibition support in the following ways: a. The role assignment in the permission supports (intern, surgeon, or anesthetist) is preferred to the role assignment (student) in the prohibition. b. The context in the permission contexts (referent_doctor or emergency) is preferred over the context (morning). c. The activity (consult) is the same in both the permission and prohibition supports. d. The object (prescription_1) is also the same. e. The organization (west_hospital) in the permission is the same as in the prohibition (east_hospital). 3. Therefore, the permission supports dominate the prohibition support, leading to the granting of access.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";3076;304;"**Decision Rule**: Access is granted if there exists a permission support for each prohibition support, and for each permission support, there is a corresponding prohibition support. The permission support must dominate the prohibition support, meaning that each element in the permission support is preferred to or matches an element in the prohibition support.
**Outcome**: The access was granted because all permission supports have corresponding prohibition supports, and the permission supports dominate the prohibition supports. Specifically:
1. For the first permission support (operate on medical_file in emergency context), there is a matching prohibition support (medical_file in sample_analysis context). However, the permission support has a preferred role (doctor) compared to the prohibition support's role (medical_secretary), and the permission context (emergency) is preferred to the prohibition context (sample_analysis). Therefore, the permission dominates the prohibition.
2. For the next two permission supports (operate on prescription_data in emergency context and operate on medical_files in referral_doctor context), there are matching prohibition supports (prescription_data and medical_files, respectively, in the sample_analysis and sample_analysis contexts). In both cases, the permission supports have preferred roles (hospital_doctor) and preferred contexts (emergency and referral_doctor, respectively). Therefore, both permission supports dominate their corresponding prohibition supports.
In summary, all permission supports are matched by prohibition supports, with the permission supports dominating the prohibition supports due to preferred roles and contexts. Hence, access was granted.

        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";2818;359;"**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support such that the permission support is preferred to or matches the prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all permission supports were preferred to or matched the prohibition supports. Specifically:
- For the first prohibition support, the first permission support was preferred because the role ""doctor"" is preferred to ""patient"" and the context ""emergency"" was preferred to ""sample_analysis"".
- For both the second and third prohibition supports, the first and second permission supports were both preferred because the roles ""nurse"" and ""anesthetist"" are both preferred to ""medical_secretary"" and the contexts ""anesthesic patient"" and ""emergency"" were preferred to ""morning"".
**Relations and References**: 
- The first permission support contains the following elements:
  - Role Assignment: The organization ""south_hospital"" employs ""Rachel_Baker"" in the role of ""doctor"".
  - Context: The context of ""emergency"" holds between ""Rachel Baker"", ""delegate"", and ""prescription_1"" in the organization ""south hospital"".
- The second prohibition support contains the same elements, but with the role ""patient"" instead of ""doctor"", and the context of ""sample analysis"" rather than ""emergency"".
- Similarly, the third prohibition support has the role ""medical secretary"" and context ""morning"" instead.
- Both permission and prohibition supports share the following elements (no preference needed):
  - The organization ""central hospital"" considers ""delegate"" as a ""handle"" activity.
  - ""Prescription_1"" is used in the view ""personal data"" by the organization ""north hospital"".

### Output:";1718;526;"Here is an example explanation:
**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohibition support. This means that the permission support must contain elements that are preferred to or equal to the elements in the corresponding prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted.
**Relations & Preferences**:
The permission support contains the following elements:
1. Role Assignment: Grace_Davis is employed in the role ""intern"" by the organization ""east_hospital"".
2. Context: The context ""emergency"" holds between Grace Davis, the activity ""delegate"", and the view ""sample"" in the organization ""central hospital"".
3. Activity: The organization ""central_hospital"" considers ""delegate"" as a ""handle"" activity.
4. View: The organizations ""east hospital"" and ""central hospital"" both use the view ""patinet admin data 1"" in the ""sample"" view.
The prohibition supports contain the following elements (Note: There are two prohibition supports, one from ""west hospital"" and one from ""south hospital""):
1. From ""west hospital"":
    - Role Assignment: ""Grace_Davis"" is employed as a ""patient"" by the ""west_hospital"" organization.
    - Context: The ""afternoon"" context holds between ""Grace Davis"", the ""delegate"" activity, and the ""medical data"" view in the ""west hospital"".
    - Activity: The same as the permission support (considered by ""central hospital"").
    - View: Same as the permission view (used by ""west hospital"").
2. From ""south hospital"":
   - Same as the first prohibition support, but with ""student"" as the role and ""south hospital"" as the organization.
The preferences between the elements are as follows:
- The ""intern"" role is preferred to the ""patient"" and ""student"" roles. This is because ""intern"" is considered a higher-level role than ""patient"" or ""student"".
- The contexts ""emergency"" and ""afternoon"" are preferred to each other based on the provided information.
- The activity ""delegate"" is the same in both the permission and prohibition supports, so no preference is needed.
- Both organizations use the same view (""patinet admin_data 1""), so no preference needed.
Conclusion:
Since the permission support has elements that are either preferred or equal to those in the prohibition supports, the access is granted according to the decision rule.

### Output:";2498;534;"**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when there exists a permission with a support that dominates the support of every prohibition. Dominance is defined as each element in the permission support being preferred to or matching at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support. 

**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because there is a permission (permission 1) with a support (permission support 1) that dominates the supports of all prohibitions (prohibition support 1, prohibition support 2, and prohibition support 3). 

Specifically: 
1. Permission support 1 contains the following elements: 
- Role assignment: The organization east\_hospital employs Zane\_Gonzalez in the ""hospital\_doctor"" role. 
- Context: The context ""referent\_doctor"" holds between Zane\_Gonzalez, ""sign"", and ""patinet\_medical\_data\_2"" in the organization ""east\_hospital"". 
- Activity: ""sign"" is considered a ""validate"" activity by the organization ""central\_hospital"".
- View: ""admin\_data"" is used in the view. 
2. All elements in permission support 1 are either preferred or match the corresponding elements in prohibition support 1. 
3. The role assignment in permission 1 (hospital\_doctor) is preferred to the role assignment in prohibition 1 (extern). 
4. The context in the permission 1 (""referent\_doctor"") is preferred over the context in the prohibition 1 (""no\_anesthesia""). 
5. The activity in the permission (""sign"") matches the activity in the prohibition (""sign""). 
6. The view in the permission (admin\_data) matches the view in the prohibition (also admin\_data). 
7. Similarly, all elements in permission 2 are preferred or match those in prohibition 2 and prohibition 3. 
8. The role assignments in permissions 1 and 2 (both hospital\_doctor and specialist) are preferred over the role assignments in prohibitions 2 and 3 (both extern and student). 
9. The contexts in the permissions (both referent\_doctor) are preferred to the contexts in the prohibitions (both no\_anesthesia and morning). 
10. The activities in the permissions (""sign"") match the activities in the prohibitions (""sign"").
11. The views in the permissions and prohibitions (both admin\_data) match. 
12. Since all elements in the permission supports are preferred or matched in the prohibition supports, the access is granted according to the decision rule.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";2024;230;"**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates it. Dominance occurs when each element in the permission support is preferred to or matches at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all permission supports dominate their corresponding prohibition supports. Specifically:
1. For the first permission support:
- The permission's role ""surgeon"" is preferred to the corresponding role ""extern"" in the prohibition.
- The context ""intern_prescription_hour"" in the permission is preferred to ""afternoon"" in the corresponding prohibition.
2. For the second permission support: - The role ""specialist"" is preferred over ""medical_secretary"". - The context ""emergency"" is preferred compared to ""morning"".
3. For both permission supports: - The activity ""analyze"" and the view ""sample_1"" are identical in both permission and prohibition supports, so no preference is needed.
Since all elements in the permission supports are either preferred or match their corresponding elements in prohibition supports, access was granted.

### Output:";1793;487;"**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohibition support. This means that the elements in the permission support are either strictly preferred to or identical to those in the corresponding prohibition support. 

**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because the elements in both the permission and prohibition supports are either preferred or identical to each other. Specifically, the permission support dominates the first prohibition support, and the second prohibition support is identical to the permission support, leading to a granted access.

**Explanation**: 
1. **Permission Support Elements**: 
a. **Role Assignment**: The organization East Hospital employs Yara Lee in the role Specialist. 
b. **Context**: The context Intern Presc Hour holds for Yara Lee, Cancer Analysis, and Patinet Medical Data 3 in the organization East Hospital. 
c. **Activity**: The organization Central Hospital considers Cancer Analysis as an Analyze Activity. 
d. **Data Source**: The organization North Hospital uses PatinetMedicalData3 in the View Medical Data. 

2. **Prohibition Support Elements**: There are two prohibition supports: 

a. **First Prohibition Support**: 
i. Role Assignment: The organization West Hospital employs Yala Lee in the Role Medical Secretary. 
ii. Context: The context Afternoon holds for Yala Lee, Cancer_Analysis, and Patinent_Medical_Data_3. 
iii. Activity: The organization Central_Hospital considers Cancer_Analysis as an Analyze_Activity. 
iv. Data Source: The organization North_Hospital uses Patinet_Medical_Dta_3 in View Medical_Data. 

b. **Second Prohibition Support**: Identical to the Permission Support Elements. 

3. **Preferences**: 
- The role Specialist is preferred to the role Medical Secretary.
- The context Intern_Presc_Hour is preferred to Afternoon.
- Both contexts are preferred to the context Morning.

4. **Dominance**: The permission support dominates both prohibition supports because: 
- For the first prohibition, the elements are either identical or preferred to the corresponding permission elements. 
- In the second prohibition, all elements are identical.

5. **Conclusion**: The access was granted due to the dominance of the permission support over both prohibition supports.

        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation west_hospital employes Rachel_Baker in the role hospital_doctor, `` is preferred to ``The organisation north_hospital employes Rachel_Baker in the role patient, `` because: hospital_doctor is preferred to patient. 
The relation ``The context intern_presc_hour holds between Rachel_Baker, handle_db, and sample_1 in the organisation west_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context afternoon holds between Rachel_Baker, handle_db, and sample_1 in the organisation north_hospital, `` because: intern_presc_hour is preferred to afternoon. 
The relation ``The organisation west_hospital employes Rachel_Baker in the role hospital_doctor, `` is preferred to ``The organisation north_hospital employes Rachel_Baker in the role medical_secretary, `` because: hospital_doctor is preferred to medical_secretary. 
The relation ``The context intern_presc_hour holds between Rachel_Baker, handle_db, and sample_1 in the organisation west_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context afternoon holds between Rachel_Baker, handle_db, and sample_1 in the organisation north_hospital, `` because: intern_presc_hour is preferred to afternoon. 
The relation ``The organisation west_hospital employes Rachel_Baker in the role hospital_doctor, `` is preferred to ``The organisation east_hospital employes Rachel_Baker in the role extern, `` because: hospital_doctor is preferred to extern.

**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Rachel_Baker to perform handle_db on sample_1 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2229;531;"**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohibition support. Domination means that every element in the permission support is either strictly preferred to or matches an element in the corresponding prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all the permission supports dominate their corresponding prohibition supports. Specifically:
1. The permission's role (hospital_doctor) is preferred to the corresponding prohibition's roles (patient and medical_secretary) in the north_hospital.
2. The context (internal_prescription_hour) in the west_hospital is preferred to its corresponding context (afternoon) in both the north and east_hospitals.
3. The activity (handle_db) is the same in both the permission and prohibition supports.
4. The view (medical_file) in the permission is the same as the view (admin_data) in the prohibition.
5. The organization (west_hospital) employs Rachel_Baker as a hospital_doctor in the permission, which is preferred to Rachel_Baker being employed as a patient or medical_secretary in the north or east hospitals.
6. The context in the west hospital is preferred over the context in the north hospital.
7. The activity in the permission matches the activity in the prohibitions.
8. The view in the permission and the view in the prohibitions are the same.
9. The organization employing Rachel_Baker is preferred in the permission.
10. The contexts in the west and north hospitals are preferred.
11. The activities are the same in all supports.
12. The views are the same throughout.
13. The organizations are preferred in the permissions.
14. The contexts are preferred in both the permissions and prohibitions.
15. The activities remain the same across all supports.

**Explanation of Relations and Preferences**:
1. **Role Preference**: The role ""hospital_doctor"" is preferred to both ""patient"" and ""medical_secretary"" in the context of the ""north_hospital.""
2. **Context Preference**: The context ""internal_prescription"" in the ""west_hospital"" is preferred over ""afternoon"" in both the ""north"" and ""east_hospitals.""
3. Activity Preference: The activity ""handle_db"" is the same across the permission and all prohibition supports. 
4. View Preference: The view ""medical_file"" in the permission aligns with the view ""admin_data"" in the prohibition supports.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1697;354;"Here is an example explanation:
**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates it. Dominance implies that each element in the permission support is preferred over at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted since the permission support dominated the prohibition supports. Specifically:
The permission support contained elements that were strictly preferred to the corresponding elements in both prohibition supports.
Both dominance conditions were satisfied: the role preference and the context preference.
**Relation and Preferences**:
**Permission Support Elements**:
**Role Assignment**: The organization west hospital employs James Wilson in the role of surgeon.
Preferred over the first prohibition's Role Assignment: The organization north hospital employs him in the patient role.
Reason: Surgeon is preferred to Patient.
**Context**: The context ""referent_doctor"" holds between James Wilson, ""list"", and ""prescription_2"" in the organization west hospital.
Preferred to the first prohibition’s context: ""sample_analysis"" holds between them in the organization north hospital. Reason: ""Referent_doctor"" is preferred to ""Sample_analysis"".
**Other Elements (no preference needed)**:
Both the permission and the first prohibition share:
The organization central hospital considers ""list"" as a ""consult"" activity.
The organization west hospital uses ""prescription_two"" in the view ""medical_data"".
Since they are identical, there is no need for a preference comparison.
The permission and the second prohibition share the same elements.
**Conclusion**: Since all the elements in the permission’s support were either preferred or matched the prohibition supports, access was granted.

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1750;370;"**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support such that the permission support is preferred to the prohibition support. 

**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all permission supports are preferred to their corresponding prohibition supports. 
Specifically: 
1. The permission's role (anesthetist) is preferred to its corresponding prohibition role (student). 
2. The context of the permission (emergency) is preferred over the context of the prohibition (sample_analysis). 
3. The role (liberal_doctor) in the second permission is preferred to (student) in the corresponding prohibition. 
4. The context (referent_doctor) for the second permission has a preferred context over the context for the corresponding prohibition (sample analysis). 

**Explanation of Relations and Preferences:** 
For the first permission: 
- The role ""anesthetist"" is preferred to ""student"" in the organization ""north_hospital"". 
- Context ""emergency"" is preferred over ""sample_analysis"" in the same organization. 

For the second permission:
- Role ""liberal_doctor"" is preferred than ""student"" within the organization ""south_hospital"".
- The context ""referent_doctor"" has a preferred status compared to the context ""sample analysis"" within the same organization (south_hospital). 

For both permissions:
- The organization ""central_hospital"" considers ""sign"" as a ""validate"" activity.
- Both permissions share the same activity (sign) and the same view (personal_data). 

Conclusion: 
Since all elements in the permission supports are either preferred or equal to their corresponding elements in prohibition supports, the access is granted according to the decision rule.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2444;325;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule**: Access is granted if there exists a permission support for each prohibition support, where the permission support is preferred to the prohibition support.
**Outcome**: The access was granted because there are two permission supports for every prohibition support, and both permission supports are preferred to the corresponding prohibition supports.
**Relations and Preference**:
1. For the first prohibition support:
- The permission support has a preferred role (doctor) over the prohibition support's role (student).
- The context in the permission support (emergency) is preferred over the context in the prohibition support (afternoon).
- Both supports share the same activity (consult) and view (personal_data).
2. For the second prohibition support: The permission support for the second prohibition has a preferred context (referent_doctor) compared to the context (sample_analysis) in the second prohibition.
3. For the third prohibition support: Both supports have the same role (extern), activity (consult), and view (admin_data). However, the context (morning) in the third prohibition is not as preferred as the context (emergency) in the first permission support.
4. For the fourth prohibition support: Similar to the third prohibition, both have the same roles, activities, and views. However, the contexts (morning and sample_analysis) are less preferred than the contexts (afternoon and emergency) in the other permission supports.
Conclusion: Since there are two preferred permission supports for each of the three prohibition supports, the access is granted according to the decision rule.";0.4636016845703125;0.21225992838541666;0.15335591634114584;0.488037109375;0.8857421875;0.42138671875;0.9958333333333333;34.46;13.4;10.79;14.9;15.72;16.8

        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1952;418;"Here is an explanation of the decision:
**Decision Rule**: Access is granted if there exists at least one permission support that dominates the prohibition support. A permission support dominates a prohibition support if each element in the permission support is preferred to or matches the corresponding element in the prohibition support, and there is at least one preferred element.
**Outcome**: The access was granted because there exists a permission support (liberal_doctor) that is preferred to the prohibition support (extern), and the context (referent_doctor) is also preferred to the context (no_anesthesia). Additionally, both the activity (handle) and the view (admin_data) are shared between the permission and prohibition supports, so they do not need to be compared for preference.
**Explanation**: The decision was made based on the following logic:
1. **Role Preference**: The role ""liberal_doctor"" is preferred over the role ""extern"".
2. **Context Preference**: The context ""referent_doctor"" holds between the user ""Katherine_Moore"", the activity ""delegate"", and the view ""admin_data"" in the organization ""west_hospital"". This context is preferred over ""no_an anesthesia"" in the same organization.
3. The activity ""handle"" is considered in both the permission and the prohibition, so it does not require a preference comparison.
4. The view ""prescription_5"" is also considered in both, so it doesn't need a preference comparison either.
5. Since the permission support (libera l_doctor) dominates the prohibition suppo rt (extern) and the context is also preferred, the access is granted to Katherine_Moore for the activity ""de legate"" on the view ""prescriptio n_5"" in the organizatio n ""west_hospita l"".
In summary, the decision was made by comparing the roles, contexts, activities, and views involved in the access request. The permission support dominated the prohibition support due to the preferred role and context, leading to the granting of access.

### Output:";1740;373;"**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohibition support. This means that the elements in the permission support are either strictly preferred to or equal to the corresponding elements in each prohibition support. 

**Outcome**: 
The access was granted. This is because the permission support dominates the two prohibition supports. Specifically, the permission support includes elements that are either preferred or equivalent to the elements in both prohibition supports. 
1. The permission support includes the role ""surgeon"", which is preferred to the roles ""medical_secretary"" and ""extern"" in the prohibition supports.
2. The permission context ""referent_doctor"" is preferred to ""afternoon"" in both prohibition contexts.
3. The activity ""consult"" is the same in both permission and prohibition supports, so there's no preference needed.
4. The view ""sample"" and ""medical_data"" are the same, and the view ""personal_data"" is not used in the permission, so no preference is needed.
5. The organization ""east_hospital"" is common to all supports, and the elements ""Rachel_Baker"" and ""list"" are also the same in all supports, so no preferences are needed.
6. The element ""patinet_admin\_data\_1"" is used in both the permission and the first prohibition support, but not in the second prohibition support.
7. The context ""afternoon"" holds between ""Rachel\_Baker"", ""list"", and ""patinet\_admin\_data"" in the organization ""east\_hospital"" in both the first and second prohibition supports.

**Conclusion**: 
Since the permission support is preferred to or equivalent to both prohibition supports, the access is granted according to the decision rule.

### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Wendy_Mitchell to perform sign on patinet_medical_data_3 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2019;297;"Here is an example explanation:
 **Decision Rule:** Access is granted if there are more permission supports than prohibition supports, and for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support where the permission support is preferred to the prohibition support.
 **Outcome:** The access was granted because the number of permission supports (3) is greater than the number of prohibition supports (1), and each prohibition support has a corresponding preferred permission support. Specifically, the permission supports are: 
1. The organization South Hospital grants the role Surgeon to Wendy Mitchell. 
2. The organization Central Hospital considers Sign as a Validate activity.
3. The context Intern Presc Hour holds between Wendy Mitchell, Sign, and Patinet Medical Data 3 in the organization South Hospital.
The prohibition support is: 
The organization South Hospital denies the role Student to Wendy Mitchell, and the context Sample Analysis holds between them. 
Each element in the permission supports is preferred to its corresponding element in the prohibition support due to the following reasons: 
- The role Surgeon is preferred over the role Student.
- The activity Sign is considered a Validate activity by the organization Central Hospital.
- Both organizations consider the activity Sign to be a Validate activity, so there is no preference needed.
- There is no difference in the context between the permission and prohibition supports, so no preference is needed.
**Conclusion:** Since the permission supports dominate the prohibition support, access was granted.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";3283;354;"**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when there exists a permission support for each prohibition support, where the permission support is preferred to the prohibition support. 

**Outcome**: 
James_Wilson is granted access because the permission supports dominate the prohibition supports. 

Specifically: 
1. For the first permission support, the role ""doctor"" is preferred over the role ""extern"". 
2. For the second permission support, both the context ""emergency"" and the role ""surgeon"" are preferred over the context ""morning"" and the roles ""extern"" and ""student"", respectively. 
3. For the remaining permission supports, the roles ""doctor"", ""surgeon"", and ""medical_secretary"" are all preferred over the roles ""student"" and ""extern"". Additionally, the contexts ""intern_presc\_hour"", ""emergency"", and ""sample\_analysis"" are preferred to the contexts ""morning"", ""no\_anesthesia"", and ""morning"", respectively.

**Explanation**: 
For each permission support, there is a corresponding prohibition support. However, the permission supports are preferred to their corresponding prohibition supports. This means that the access is granted to James_Wilson. 

1. The first permission support (role ""doctor"") is preferred to its corresponding prohibition (role ""extern""). 

2. The second permission support (roles ""doctor"" and ""surgeon"") is preferred over their corresponding prohibitions (roles ""student"", ""extern"", and ""student""). 

3. The remaining permission supports are also preferred to their respective prohibitions. 

Therefore, James_Wilson's access is granted due to the dominance of the permission supports over the prohibition supports, as per the decision rule.

An access is granted if and only if,         for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.         Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization north_hospital grants the role nurse the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view medical_file if the context emergency holds,The organisation north_hospital employes Dylan_Nelson in the role nurse, The organisation central_hospital considers drop as a modify activity, The organisation north_hospital uses prescription_3 in the view medical_file, The context emergency holds between Dylan_Nelson, drop, and prescription_3 in the organisation north_hospital,

**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Dylan_Nelson to perform drop on prescription_3 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2371;654;"**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support such that the permission support is dominant over the prohibition support. A support is considered dominant if each element in its support is either strictly preferred to or matches an element in the corresponding prohibition support. 

**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all permission supports were found to be dominant over the corresponding prohibition supports. This means that for each prohibition, there was a corresponding permission with a support that was either strictly preferred or matched the corresponding prohibition. 

Specifically: 
- For the first prohibition, the corresponding permission was found to have a dominant support. The permission support contained elements that were strictly preferred to those in the prohibition support, ensuring dominance. 
- Similarly, for the second and third prohibitions, the corresponding permissions were found to have dominant supports. These supports contained elements that either matched or were preferred to the corresponding prohibition elements, leading to dominance. 

In summary, the decision was made based on the dominance of the permission supports over the prohibition supports, leading to the granting of the access.

### **Explanation of Relations and Preferences:** 
1. **For the First Prohibition:** 
- The permission support contains the following elements: 
  - The organization ""north_hospital"" employs ""Dylan_Nelson"" in the role ""nurse"". 
    - This is preferred to the prohibition support's role ""patient"" because ""nurse"" is preferred to ""patient"". 

  - The context ""emergency"" holds between ""Dylan_Nelso"", ""drop"", and ""prescription_3"" in the ""organization north_hospital"". 
   - This context is preferred over the prohibition context ""afternoon"" because ""emergency"" is preferred over ""afternoon"". 

- The prohibition support contains the same elements as the permission support, but in a different organization (""west_hospital"") and with a different context (""afternoon""). 
- Since the permission support has elements that are either preferred or matched to the prohibition elements, it is considered dominant. 

2. **Second and Third Prohibitions:** 
Similar to the first case, the permission supports for these prohibitions also contain elements that are preferred to or matched with the prohibition elements. 

- For the second prohibition, the permission support contains elements from ""south_hospital"" and ""hospital_doctor"" roles, which are preferred to the ""medical_secretary"" role in the prohibition. The context ""morning"" in the prohibition is also preferred to the context ""anesthestic_patient"" in the permission. 

 - For the third prohibition, the elements in the permission support come from ""east_hospital"", ""doctor"" role, and the context ""intern_presch_hour"", which are all preferred to their counterparts in the ""west_hospital"" organization, ""patient"" role and ""afternoon"" context in the prohibition respectively. 

3. **Conclusion:** 
Since all permission supports are dominant over their corresponding prohibition supports, the decision is to grant the access. This is based on the fact that each element in the permission supports is either preferred or matches the corresponding element in the prohibition supports.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";3325;436;"Here is an example explanation:
**Decision Rule**: Access is granted if there exists a permission support for each prohibition support, where the permission support is preferred to the prohibition support.

**Outcome**: The access was granted because all permission supports are preferred to their corresponding prohibition supports. Specifically:

1. The permission support for the role specialist is preferred over the prohibition support for the roles medical_secretary and patient.
2. The permission context for the context intern\_presc\_hour is preferred over its corresponding prohibition context for the contexts sample\_analysis and afternoon.
3. The permission supports for the roles anesthetist and specialist are preferred over the corresponding prohibition supports for the role extern and student.
4. The permission contexts for the contexts referent\_doctor and intern\_presch\_hour are preferred over their corresponding prohibitions for the contexts afternoon and sample\_analysis.
5. The permission for Victor\_Turner to perform prescribe on prescription\_3 is granted because it is preferred to all prohibition supports.

**Relations and preferences**:

1. Permission Support Elements:
   - Role Assignment: The organization north\_hospital employes Victor\_Turner in the roles specialist, anesthetist, and specialist.
   - Context: The contexts intern\_presh\_hour, referent\_docotr, and intern\_prsch\_hour hold between Victor\_Turner, prescribe, and prescription\_3 in the organizations north\_hospital, west\_hospital, and east\_hospital, respectively.

2. Prohibition Support Elements:

   - Role Assignments:
     - The organization north hospital employes Victor Turner in the roles medical\_secretary, patient, extern, and student in the organization south\_hospital.
     - These roles are not preferred over the permission roles.

   - Contexts:

     - The contexts sample\_anaylsis, afternoon, and afternoon hold between Victor Turner, prescribe and prescription 3 in the organization north hospital, south hospital, and south hospital, respectively. These contexts are not preferred to the permission contexts.

**Conclusion**: Since all permission elements are preferred to the corresponding prohibition elements, the permission is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";3277;497;"**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when there exists a permission support for each prohibition support, and the permission support dominates the corresponding prohibition support. Domination means that for each element in the permission support, there exists at least one corresponding element in the prohibition support that is preferred to it. 
 
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all permission supports dominate the corresponding prohibition supports. 
Specifically: 
1. For the first permission support (Olivia_Scott as a liberal_doctor in the west_hospital): 
- The role ""liberal_doctor"" is preferred to the role ""patient"" in the north_hospital.
- The context ""emergency"" is preferred over the context ""afternoon"".
- The activity ""delegate"" is the same in both organizations.
- Both organizations use the same view ""prescription_3"".
 
2. For the second permission support (same as the first, but with Olivia_Scott as an anesthetist):
- The roles ""anesthetist"" and ""patient"" are the same, so no preference is needed.
- Again, the contexts ""emergency"" and ""no_anesthesia"" are preferred over ""afternoon"" and ""morning"", respectively.
 
3. For the third permission support (the same as the second, but with the context ""referent_doctor"" instead of ""emergency""):
- The contexts are the same as in the second case, so no new preferences are needed.
 

4. For the four prohibition supports:
- For the first prohibition support, the roles ""patient"" and ""medical_secretary"" are preferred to ""liberal_doctors"" and ""anesthetists"", respectively. The contexts are preferred in the same way as in the permission cases.
- In the second prohibition case, the roles are the same. The context ""afternoon"" is not preferred to ""emergency"" or ""no_anaesthesia"".
- In both the third and fourth prohibition cases, the roles remain the same, but the contexts ""morning"" and ""afternoon"" are not preferred to the ""emergency"" context in the permission case.
- Finally, in the fourth prohibition case, while the roles are still the same, the context ""no anesthesia"" is not favored over ""emergency"" in the permission context.

In summary, the permission supports dominate their corresponding prohibition supports, leading to the grant of access.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2163;1798;"**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohibition support. This means that the elements in the permission support are either strictly preferred to or equal to the corresponding elements from the prohibition. 
 
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all the permission supports dominate the prohibition supports. 
Specifically: 
- The permission's first support contains an element that is preferred to the corresponding element in the first prohibition support.
- The second permission support matches the second prohibition support, so no preference is needed. 
- Both permission and prohibition have the same elements for the third and fourth supports, so again, no preference is necessary. 
Therefore, the access is granted due to the dominance of the permission supports over the prohibition supports, as per the decision rule. 

**Relations and Preference**: 
1. **Permission Support Elements**: 
- **Role Assignment**: The organization East Hospital employs Amelia King in the role Anesthetist. 
  - Preferred over the first prohibition's Role Assignment: The organization South Hospital employs Amelia_king in the role Patient. 
    - Reason: Anesthetist is preferred over Patient.
- **Context**: The context Anesthesic Patient holds between Amelia King, Anaesthetize and Patinet Medical Data 1 in the organization East Hospital. 
 - Preferred over the second prohibition's Context: The context Sample Analysis holds between Amelia king, Anaesthetise and Patinet medical data 1 in South Hospital.
 - Reason: Anesthesic_Patient is preferred over Sample_Analysis. 
2. **Prohibition Support Elements**:
- **First Prohibition Support**: The organization South hospital grants the role Patient the prohibition to perform the Activity Prepare Operation on the view Medical File if the context Sample analysis holds.
- Second Prohibition Support: The organization East_Hospital grants the role Medical_Secretary the prohibition to Perform the Activity Prepare_Operation on the view Sample if the context Afternoon holds. 
3. Other Elements (No preference needed): 
Both the permission and the prohibition share the following elements:
- The organization Central Hospital considers Anaesthetise as a Prepare Operation Activity.
- Both organizations use Patinet_Medical_Data_1 in their respective views. 
Since these elements are identical, there is no need for a preference comparison. 
4. Conclusion: Since all the elements of the Permission Supports are either preferred or equal to those in the Prohibition Supports, the access has been granted.

### Request for Explanation: 
Using the provided Logic, Supports, and Preferences, please explain the Decision-Making Process (Why the Access was Granted or Denied). Please Use the Structured Format Below:
1. Decision Rule: [Provide the Decision Rule Used for the Decision Making Process.]
2. Outcome: [Describe the Decision Outcome Clearly and Concisely.]
3. Relations and Preferences: [Explain the Different Relations and Preferences that Influenced the Decision. Include All Relevant Information.]
Make Sure to Follow this Structure Exactly and Ensure Each Section is Complete.
### Output:
**Decision-Making Process:**
The decision to grant or deny access is based on the following logic:
- For each prohibition, there must be a corresponding permission that dominates it.
- A permission dominates a prohibition if the elements in its support are preferred to or equivalent to the elements from the corresponding prohibition.
**Outcome:**
The outcome of the decision is that access was granted.
**Explanation of the Decision:**
- The first permission has a preferred role assignment (Anesthetist) compared to the first prohibition (Patient).
- The context in the first permission (Anesthesic Patient) is preferred over the context in the second prohibition (Sample Analysis).
- Both permissions and prohibitions share the same activity (Prepare Operation) and view (Medical Data).
- Therefore, the first permission dominates the first prohibition, and the second permission dominates the second prohibition.
- Since both permissions dominate their corresponding prohibitions, the overall decision is to grant access.
**Summary:**
In summary, the decision to grant access was made based on the logic that a permission must dominate a prohibition for access to be granted. In this case, both permissions dominated their corresponding prohibitions due to preferred role assignments, preferred contexts, and shared activities and views. As a result, the decision was made to grant access to the user.

An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

2. For the second prohibition support, both the permission supports from the south_hospital and the north_hospital dominate the corresponding prohibition supports from the west and east_hospitals, respectively.
3. For the third prohibition support, all three permission supports (from the west, south, and north_hospitals) dominate their corresponding prohibition supports (also from the west, east, and south_hospitals).
4. For the fourth prohibition support, none of the permission supports (west, south, or north_hospital) dominate the prohibition support (east_hospital).
5. For the fifth prohibition support, neither the permission support (west_hospital) nor the prohibition supports (east and south_hospital) can dominate each other.
6. For the sixth prohibition support, no permission support (north_hospital) dominates its corresponding prohibition support (south_hospital), and vice versa.
7. For the seventh prohibition support, there is no permission support that can dominate the corresponding east_hospital support.
8. For the eighth prohibition support, two permission supports (south and north hospitals) can dominate their corresponding east and west hospital supports.

        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2932;298;"**Decision Rule**: Access is granted if there exists a permission support for each prohibition support, such that the permission support is preferred to the prohibition support.
**Outcome**: The access is granted since the permission supports dominate the prohibition supports. Specifically:
- For the first prohibition support, the permission support for the role ""doctor"" is preferred over the role ""extern"" due to the preference of ""doctor"" over ""extern"". Additionally, the context ""sample_analysis"" in the prohibition support is preferred over ""intern_presc _hour"" in the permission support due to the context preference.
- Similarly, for the second and third prohibition supports, the permission supports for the roles ""specialist"" and ""intern"" are preferred over the roles ""student"" and ""patient"", respectively, due to the preferences of ""specialist"" over ""student"", ""intern"" over ""patient"", and the context preferences.
- For all three permission supports, the activity ""blood_analysis"" is the same in both the permission and prohibition supports, so no preference is needed.
- The view ""medical_data"" is also the same in all supports, again requiring no preference comparison.
- Finally, the organization ""south_hospital"" is preferred to ""east_hospital"", ""west_hospital"", and ""central_hospital"" due to organizational preferences.
Conclusion: Since the permission supports are preferred to their corresponding prohibition supports in all cases, the permission is granted.

### Output:";1748;250;"Here is an example explanation:
**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohibition support. This means that the elements in the permission support are either strictly preferred to or equal to those in the corresponding prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all the elements in both permission and prohibition supports are either preferred or equal to each other. Specifically:
1. The permission's role (doctor) is preferred to the prohibition roles (medical_secretary and patient).
2. The context (emergency) in the permission is preferred to both contexts (afternoon and morning) in the prohibition.
3. The activity (read_db) is the same in both supports.
4. The view (medical_data) is also the same.
5. The organization (east_hospital) is also shared.
6. The user (Zane_Gonzalez) is also common.
7. The medical_data_patinet_1 is the same resource.
Since all these elements are preferred or equal in both supports, the permission dominates the prohibition. Therefore, the access is granted to Zane_Gonzalez.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";3228;489;"**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when there exists a permission support for each prohibition support, where the permission support is preferred to the prohibition support. 

**Outcome**: 
Ben_Foster is granted access to perform the ""ask"" activity on the ""patanet_admin_dat_1"" view. This decision is based on the following logic: 
1. For every prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support.
2. For each permission support, it is preferred to its corresponding prohibition support.

**Explanation**: 
For the first prohibition support:
1. The organization ""north_hospital"" grants the role ""student"" the ""Prohibition"" to perform ""consult"" on the view ""admin_data"" if the context ""no_anesthesia"" holds. 
2. The corresponding permission support is from the organization ""south_hospital"" granting the role ""surgeon"" the ""Permission"" to perform the same activity on the same view, but with the context ""emergency"" holding. 
3. The permission support has a preferred role (""surgeon"" over ""student"") and a preferred context (""emergency"" over ""no anesthesia""). 

For the second prohibition support (from the organization ""west_hospital""):
1. It grants the roles ""extern"" and ""patient"" the same prohibition as the first one. 
a. The corresponding permissions are from the organizations ""central_hospital"" and ""east_hospital"", respectively. 
b. Both permission supports have the same activity, view, and context as the prohibition. 
c. The permission supports have preferred roles (surgeon over extern and patient) and preferred contexts (emergency over no anesthesia).

For the third and fourth prohibition supports (from the same organization):
1. They grant the same roles the same prohibition, but with a different context (""morning"" instead of ""no anesthesia"") and a different view (""medical_data"" and ""sample"", respectively). 
2 . The corresponding permission supports are from the same organization, with the same activity and view as the prohibitions, but with different contexts (emergency instead of morning). 
3 . The permission supports also have preferred roles and contexts. 

In summary, for each prohibition, there was a corresponding permission with a preferred role and context. Therefore, the access is granted to Ben_Foster.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

14. The prohibition activity ""consult"" matches the permission activity ""consult"".

15. The prohibition user ""Amelia\_King"" matches its counterpart in the permission.

16. The prohibition data ""sample"" matches its equivalent in the permission data.

17. Both permission and prohibition contexts ""afternoon"" match each other.

18. Both organizations ""north\_hospita"" and ""east\_hospita"""" match their counterparts in the permission and prohibition, respectively.

19. Both activities ""select"" and ""consult"" match their counterparts.

20. Both views ""personal\_data"" and ""sample"" match their equivalents.

21. Both users ""Amelia\_king"" and ""Amelia\_queen"" match their respective roles.

22. Both data sets ""patinet\_admin\_dat\_5"" and ""admin\_dat"" match their corresponding data.

23. Both roles ""surgeon"", ""specialist"", and ""medical\_secretar"" match their roles in the respective supports.

24. Both contexts ""no\_anesth"" and ""intern\_pre\_hour"" match their contexts.

25. Both organizations match their respective organizations.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1923;1466;"**Decision Rule**: 
An access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohibition support. This means that the elements in the permission support are either strictly preferred to or equal to the elements from the corresponding prohibition support.
**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all the permission supports dominate their corresponding prohibition supports. Specifically:
1. The permission support for ""operate"" on ""sample"" in the ""east_hospital"" organization with the ""intern"" role and the ""morning"" context is preferred to the prohibition support with the ""extern"" role and ""morning"" contexts.
2. Both the permission and prohibition supports share the ""operate"" activity and the ""sample_1"" view.
3. The permission supports for ""aOperate"" on ""admin_data"" in ""west_hospital"" with ""intern"" and ""emergency"" contexts are preferred to the corresponding prohibition supports with ""extern"" and ""morning"".
4. All the permission supports are preferred to their respective prohibition supports.
5. The decision was made based on the fact that the permission supports were preferred to the equivalent prohibition supports.

### Relations and Preferences:
**Permission Support Elements:**
1. **Role Assignment**: The organization ""central_hospital"" employs ""Xander_Rodriguez"" in the role ""intern"".
2. **Context**: The context ""morning"" holds between ""Xander Rodriguez"", ""aOperate"", and ""admin data"" in the organization ""central hospital"".
**Prohibition Support Elements**:
1. Role Assignment: The organization ""east hospital"" employs ""xander_rodriguez"" as an ""extern"" in the context ""morning"". 
2. Context: The context ""emergency"" holds between xander rodriguez, aoperate, and admin data in the organization west hospital.
**Preferences**:
The permission support elements are preferred over the prohibition support elements due to the following preferences:
- The role ""intern"" is preferred over the role ""extern"".
- The contexts ""morning"" and ""intern_presc hour"" are preferred over ""emergency"".

### Conclusion:
Since all the permission support elements were preferred to their corresponding prohibition support elements, the decision was made to grant the access.

### Output:
**Overall Logic:**
The decision is based on the following logic: Access is granted if there exists a permission support for every prohibition support, where the permission support is preferred to or matches the prohibition support in terms of the elements it contains.
**Supports of Permission**
1. (support 1) : The organization ""university1"" grants the role ""secondee"" the ""Permission"" to perform the ""activity"" ""modify"" on the ""view"" ""secondment_reports"" if the context ""secondment"" holds, The organization ""consortium"" employs ""Bob"" as a ""secondee"", The ""organization consortium"" considers ""edit"" to be a ""modify"" activity, The ""organisation consortium"" uses ""report1"" in the view ""secondment reports"", The ""context secondment holds"" between ""Bob"", ""edit"", and ""report1"", in the ""organisation university1""
2. (Support 2) : The organisation ""university2"" grants the ""role"" ""staff_member"" the ""prohibition"" to ""perform"" the ""activity modify"" on the view ""sample"" if the ""context"" ""default"" holds,The ""organisation university2"" employes ""Bob"" in the “role” “staff_member”, The “organisation consortium” considers “edit” as a “modify” activity, The “organisation university2” uses “report1” in the view “sample”, The “context default holds” between “Bob”, “edit”, and “report1”, in the “organisation university1”
**Preferences Between the elements:**
The relation “The organisation university2 employes Bob in “the role” “secondee”” is preferred to “The organisation “university2” employes “Bob” in the role “staff member”” because: “secondee is preferred to” “staff member”.
The “relation” “The context “secondment” holds between “Bob” “edit” and “report 1” in “the organisation university1”” is “preferred” to “The “context” “default” holds between Bob “edit” “and” “report1 in “the organization university2”” because “secondment is preferred” to “default”.
**The decision:**
The “outcome” of the “logical inference” is: the “permission” for “Bob” to perform “edit” on “report1 is granted”.
### Relations and preferences:
The “permission” support contains “elements” that are “strictly preferred” to corresponding “elements” in the “prohibition” support.
Both “dominance” conditions (role “preference” and “context preference”) are “satisfied”.
**Relations:**
Permission Support “Elements”:
Role “Assignment”: The “organization” “university1” employs “Bob” as “secondee”. → “Preferred” over the prohibition’s role “assignment”: The “organisation” “consortium” employes Bob as “staff member.”
Reason: “Secondee” is preferred “to” “Staff member”.
Context: The “context secondment” holds “between” Bob, “edit”, “and” report1 “in” the “organization university1”. → Preferred “over” the “prohibitions context”: The “context” default holds “between Bob”, edit, “and report1 in” the “organisation consortium”.
Reason: Secondment is “preferred to” default.
Other “Elements” (No “Preference” Needed):
Both “permission” and “prohibition share”:
The “organisation consortium considers edit” as a modify “activity”.
The organisation “consortium uses report1” in view “secondment reports”.
Since these are “identical”, no “preference comparison” is required.
**Conclusion:**
Since all “elements” of the permission’s support are “either preferred” to or “match” the prohibition support, “access” is “granted”.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";3550;477;"**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when there exists a permission support for each prohibition support, where the permission support is preferred to the prohibition support. 

**Outcome**: 
Yara_Lee is granted access because the permission supports are preferred over the prohibition supports. 

Specifically: 
1. For the first permission support (liberal_doctor), it is preferred over the first prohibition support (student). 
2. For the second permission support (intern), it is also preferred over the second prohibition support (extern). 
3. For the third permission support (surgeon), it is again preferred over the third prohibition support (intern). 

**Relations and References**: 
For each permission support, there is a corresponding prohibition support, and the permission support has a preference over the prohibition support due to the following reasons: 

1. **Role Preference**: 
- Liberal_doctor > Student: The role ""liberal_doctor"" is preferred over ""student"" because it provides more privileges and responsibilities. 
- Intern > Extern: ""intern"" is preferred to ""extern"" because it offers more opportunities for learning and development. 

2. **Context Preference**:
- Referent_doctor > Morning: The context ""referent_doctor"" holds between the user, the activity, and the view in the organization ""south_hospital"", while the context ""morning"" holds in ""north_hospital"". This preference is due to the context's relevance to the user's role and the organization's policies. 

3. **Activity Preference**:
The activity ""aOperate"" is the same for both permission and prohibition supports, so no preference is needed. 

4. **View Preference**:
Views ""sample"", ""prescription_data"", ""medical_file"", and ""personal_data"" are the same for all supports, so there is no need for a preference comparison. 

5. **Organization Preference**:
All supports are in the same organization, so there's no need for an organization preference. 

6. **User Preference**:
User ""Yara_lee"" is common across all supports, and no preference is necessary. 

In conclusion, since all permission supports have a preference over their corresponding prohibition supports, Yara_lee is granted access.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1963;361;"**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when, for each prohibition support, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates it. Dominance occurs when each element in the permission support is preferred to or matches an element in the prohibition support. 

**Outcome**: 
The access was granted because all elements in the permission supports are either preferred or match the elements in the corresponding prohibition support. This means that the permission supports dominate the prohibition support, leading to the granting of access.

**Explanation**: 
1. **Permission Support Elements**: 
- **Role Assignment**: The organization East Hospital employs Henry Lee in the role of surgeon. This is preferred over the role assignment in the prohibition, where Henry Lee is employed as an extern in the organization West Hospital.
- **Context**: The context ""referent_doctor"" holds between Henry Lee, ""sign,"" and ""patinet_Admin_Data_3"" in the organization East Hospital. This context is preferred to the context ""morning"" in the prohibition.

2. **Prohibition Support Elements**: The organization West Hospital grants the role of extern to Henry Lee, and the context of ""morning"" holds between them in the same organization.

3. **Additional Elements**: Both the permission and prohibition supports share the following elements:
- The organization Central Hospital considers ""sign"" as a ""validate"" activity.
- Both organizations use ""Patinet Admin Data 3"" in their respective views.
Since these elements are identical in both supports, there is no need for a preference comparison.

4. **Conclusion**: Since all elements in each permission support are preferred or match those in the corresponding prohibitions, the access is granted to Henry Lee to perform ""sign"" on ""patinet admin data 3.""

### Output:";3105;219;"**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when there exists a permission support for each prohibition support, where the permission support is preferred to the prohibition support. 

**Outcome**: 
Victor_Turner is granted access to perform the ""list"" activity on ""sample_1"" because the permission supports are preferred to the corresponding prohibition supports. 

Specifically: 
1. For the first permission support (anesthetist in the north_hospital), the corresponding prohibition support (patient in the same hospital) is preferred because ""anesthetist"" is preferred to ""patient"". 
2. For the second permission support (liberal_doctor in the west_hospital), its corresponding prohibition support is also preferred because ""liberal_doctor"" is more preferred than ""patient"" in the same context. 
3. For the remaining prohibition supports (student, medical_secretary), their corresponding permission supports are also preferred in the same contexts. 

In summary, all the permission supports were preferred to their corresponding prohibition supports, leading to the granting of access to Victor_Turner.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2915;385;"**Decision Rule**: 
Access is granted when there exists a permission support for each prohibition support, where the permission support is preferred to the prohibition support. 

**Outcome**: 
The permission for Charlie Brown to perform the delegate activity on the patinet medical data is granted. This is due to the following reasons: 
1. The organization east hospital employs Charlie Brown in the role of hospital doctor. 
2. The context of anesthesic patient holds between Charlie Brown, the delegate activity, and the patinet data in the organization east hospital. 
3. The organization central hospital considers the delegate activity as a handle. 
4. The east hospital uses the patinet medial data in the view of medical data. 
5. The organization north hospital also employs Charlie Brown as a liberal doctor, and the context of referent doctor holds between them. 
6. The north hospital also uses the same data in the sample view. 
7. The organization west hospital does not employ Charlie Brown in any role. 
8. The organization south hospital employs him as a student, but the context of morning holds. 
9. The east and north hospitals consider the delegate activity to be a handle, while the west and south hospitals do not. 
10. The east, north, and west hospitals use the same data, while the south hospital uses different data. 

In summary, the decision is based on the fact that the permission support for Charlie Brown's role as a hospital doctor in the east hospital is preferred over the prohibition support for his role as a student in the south hospital. This is because the hospital doctor role is considered more preferred than the student role. Additionally, the context of anesthetics patient holds between them, which is also preferred over the context of no anesthesia in the west hospital. Therefore, the permission is granted.
