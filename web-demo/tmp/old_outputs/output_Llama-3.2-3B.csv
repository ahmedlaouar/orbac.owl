- The preference between ""Nathan_white as a researcher"" and ""Nathan white as a seconde"" was not used.
- The preferences between ""the context audit"" and ""the context collaboration"" were not used either.

The final explanation of this decision was the following one:

The decision rule was what was presented during the class. The outcome was that access was granted to Nathan white to perform the ""copy"" activity on ""dataset 10"". This decision was not based on any preference between the two contexts (audit and collaboration). The decision was based on the fact that Nathan white was a researcher, which was preferred to being a seconde.

2) **Decision Outcome**: The decision outcome is that the access is granted to Rachel_Baker. 
3) **Reasoning**: The reasoning that led to the decision is the following: The relation ""Rachel_Baker works for Institute2"" is preferred to ""Baker works for University1"" because Baker is an employee and employees are preferred to students. The preference ""University2 is more important than University1"" leads to the access being granted because important organizations are preferred to unimportant ones. The relation ""Institute2 employs Baker in the role of team_leader"" is preferred over the relation ""University1 employs Baker as a PhD_student"" because team_leader is a preferred role than PhD_student. Finally, the preference ""secondment is preferred over default"" leads to granting the access because secondments are preferred over defaults.

- The relation secondment used at the context in the organisation Institutite 3 is preferred over the relation default used at the contet in the organisation Universities 2 because secondment > default.

- The relations wp_leader and coordinator at the roles at the organisation instituite 1 are prefered over the relations staff_member and associate_professor at the roles in the organisation instituitie 2 because: wp leader > staff_member and coordinator > associate professor

- The relations audit and collaboration at the contexts at the organisation institute 1 and 2 are preferred over each other because: audit > collaboration and collaboration > audit

- The preference of the relation insert at the activity at the organisation consortium is not preferred over any other relation because insert is not related to any other element in the decision.

2. **Outcome Decision:** The decision is that the permission to perform create is granted. 
3. **Relations and Preferences Leading to the Decision:** The relations and preferences that lead to the decision are the following: 
- The relation ``create is preferred to create, `` because create is a modify activity and create is a create activity. 
- The preference ``The organisation Consortium considers modify as a create activity, `` overwrites the preference ``The organization University1 employs Eva_Clark as an associate_professor in the role of post_doc,`` because the preference of the organization University1 is overwritten by the preference of The organisation Consortium. 
- This preference overwrites the relation ``Eva_Clark is a post_doc in the organization University3,`` because Eva_Clark is not a post_doc but a coordinator in the organization Institute3. 
- In the same way, the preference ``create is a modify action,`` overwrites the preferences ``create is not a create action,`` because create is not a modify action but a create action. 
- These preferences overwrites the relations ``create is less preferred than create,`` because modify is more preferred than create. 
- Finally, these preferences overwrites all the relations and preferences between the elements of the supports of the permission and the prohibition. 

**Conclusion:** The decision was made based on the decision rule, which is that the access is granted only if there exists a permission support that dominates the prohibition support. In this specific case, the permission support is dominated by the prohibition support, so the access is denied.

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;3059;290;"The explanation must include the following elements:
- The used decision rule,
- The outcome decision,
- The different elements composing the decision, and
- The different relationships and preferences that led to the decision.
1. **Used Decision Rule:** The used decision rules is the one that says that an access can be granted only if the support of permission dominates the support of prohibition.
2. **Decision Outcome:** The decision outcome is that access is granted.
3. **Elements Composing the Decision:** 
- The permission to perform the action create is granted.
- The prohibition to perform the act modify is denied.
4. **Relationships and Preferences Leading To the Decision:**
- The relation ""create is preferred over create"" because create is preferred over modify.
- The preference ""The organization Institute3 employs Eva_Clark as a coordinator"" overwrites ""Eva_Clark is an associate professor in the University 1"" because the preferences of the organization Institute 3 overwrite the preferences of University 1.
- This preference also overwrites ""create is a create action"" because create isn't a create action but a modify action.
- These preferences also overwrite ""create is less prefered than create"" because modify is prefered over create.
- Finally these preferences also overwrite all the relations between the elements in the supports of permission and prohibition.
5. **Conclusion:** The access is denied because the permission support doesn't dominate the prohibition support.

An access is granted if and only if,         for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.         Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;2996;309;"The edited explanation must include:
- The decision outcome,
- The elements composing the permission and prohibition supports,
- The relations and preferences that lead to the decision,
- And the conclusion of the decision.

1. **Decision Outcomes:** The decision outcomes is that the access is granted because the permission to perform create is granted and the prohibition to perform modify is denied. 
2. **Permission and Prohibition Supports:** The permission support is composed of the elements: 
- Eva_Clark is a coordinator in the Institute 3,
- Create is a modify action,
- Dataset1 is used in the view Internal_data,
- The context audit is present in the organization Institute3.
The prohibition support is composed by the elements:
- Eva_Clack is a post_doc in the University3,
- Modify is a modify activity,
- Dataset 1 is used on the view Wp2,
- The default context is present in University3.
3. ***Relations and Preferences Leading to the Decision:*** 
- The preference of the Institute3 overwrites the preference of the University3 because the Institute3 is preferred over the University3. 
- This preference overwrites the relation between Eva_Clack and post_doc because post_doc is preferred over coordinator. 
- Then this preference overwrites all the relations and preferences between the elements of the supports of the permission and the prohibition. 
4. **Conclusions:** The conclusion is that the permission is granted because it dominates the prohibition and the prohibition is denied because it doesn't dominates the permission.

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;3040;467;"The edited explanations must include:
1. **The decision outcome:** The decision outcome is that the permissions to perform create are granted and the prohibitions to perform modify are denied.
2. **Elements Composing the Permission and Prohibition Support:** The permission and prohibition support are composed by the following elements:
- The organization Institute 3 grants the coordinator role to Eva_Clark,
- The organization University 1 grants the associate_professor role to Eva_clark,
- Eva_clark is a researcher in the Institute3,
- Eva clark is an associate_professor in the University1,
- The organisation Institute 3 employs Eva_clark in the coordinator role,
- The Organisation University 1 employs Eva clark in the associate professor role,
- Eva Clark is a post doc in the University 1,
- Eva Clark is a postdoc in the University2,
- Eva Clarke is an associate professor in the university 2,
- create is a modify in the university1,
- create and modify are modifies in the university2,
- dataset 1 is a dataset in the university3,
- dataset1 and dataset 2 are datasets in the university5,
- create, modify and dataset 1 are modifies in institute3,
- The Organization University 1 holds the default context,
- The Context audit holds in the organization institute 3
3. **The Relations and Preferences that Lead to the Decision:** 
- The relation between Eva_clark and post_doc is overriden by the preference of institute 3 over university 1 because institute 3 is preferred to university 1.
- This preference overrides all the relations between the elements that composes the prohibition and permission supports.
- The preference between institute 3 and university 2 is overrided by the preference between university 1 and university 3 because university 1 is preferred over university 3.
- This preferences overwrites the relations between Eva clark and postdoc in university 2.
- The preferences between institute 1 and institute 2 overwrites the preferences between university 2 and institute 3 because institute 2 is preferred over institute 3.
4. **The Conclusions:** The conclusions are that the permissions are granted because they dominate the prohibitions and that the prohibitions are denied because they don't dominate the permissions.

2. **Outcome Decision:** The decision is that the permission to perform grep is granted. 
3. **Relations and Preferences Leading to the Decision:** The relations and preferences that lead to the decision are the following: The relation ``Zane_Gonzales is an employee of the Institute2,`` is preferred to the relation ``He is a PhD_student of the University1,`` because the role of a PhD_student is less preferred than the role of an employee of an institute. The same goes for the relation ``The organization Institute2 holds the context management,`` and the relation ``University1 holds the context collaboration,`` because management is more preferred than collaboration. Finally, the relation ``Full_professor is a more preferred role than PhD_student,`` leads to the conclusion that the permission is granted.

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;2633;1787;"The decision is to deny the access to Zane_Gonazles to perform the consult activity on report 3. The decision is made using the decision rule proposed by the authors of the paper, which states that an access should be denied if there is at least one prohibition whose support dominates the permission. In this case, there are two prohibitions whose supports strictly dominate the permission. The first prohibition is that no organization grants any role to any person to perform any activity on any view. The second prohibition is that there is no organization that grants the role of PhD_student to any person. Both of these prohibitions are supported by the fact that there are no organizations that grant the role of full_professor to any person, and that there are also no organizations that consider the activity of consult as a teach or a learn activity. The fact that no organization considers the activity of teach as a learn or a teach activity is supported by the facts that no organization uses the view public in any context, and that no organization employs any person in the role of teacher. The same applies to the fact that no organizations use the view private in any context and that no organizations employ any person with the role of student. Finally, it is also true that no organizations consider the activities of study, work, conduct research, publish, collaborate, and train as a teach, a learn, or a study activity. As a result, there are no supports for the permission, so the access is denied.
3. **Overall logic:** Explain the rules under which access should be granted or denied. A permission should be granted if there exists a support for that permission that strictly dominates any support for any prohibition. A prohibition should be granted when there exists a prohibition whose support strictly dominates any permission. Here is the list of the different elements composing the decision: 
1. **Support of Permission:** The elements composing the support of a permission are: (support of permission 1): the organization University3 holds the context audit, (support of permissions 2): the

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;1033;491;"The decision is made using the overall logic, which states that access is granted when there exists a support for the permission that dominates the support for the prohibition. 
In this case, the permission is to perform the sign activity on the dataset 4, and the prohibition is to perform a validate activity on the reports view. 
The supports of the permission are: 
- The institute2 employs Paul_harris as a coordinator, 
- The context of secondment is hold between Paul_harris, sign and dataset 4 in the institute2, 
- Wp1 is used by the institute2 on the view wp1, 
- Sign is considered a validate activity by the consortium, 
- Dataset 4 is used on the wp1 view by the institute 2. 
The support of the prohibitioin is: 
- Paul_harris is employed as a secondee by the university 3, 
- Collaboration is the context of the secondee role, 
- Secondment_report is the view where the validate activity is performed, 
- Data_set_4 is used in the secondment_report view by the univeristy 3. 
The preference between the elements of the supports is: 
The institute2 employs paul_harris as coordinator is preferred over the university3 employes paulharris as staffmember because coordinator is prefered over staffmember. 
The context of the secondment is held between paul_harris,sign and dataset_4 is preferred over the context of collabration is held between pahulharris, sign,and dataset_4 because secondment is prefered to collabration. 
The view wp1 is used on view wp1 by the institute_2 is preferred to the secondment report is used on secondment_report by the university_3 because wp1 is prefered o secondment_report. 
Sign is considered a validte activity by the consoritum is prefered ot the seconde activity is considered by the university3 becuase sign is preferred over seconde. 
Dataset_4 is uesd in the view wp_1 by the institue_2 is preferred over dataset_4 used in the seconment_report view bby the univerisity_3 becuause wp1 is preferred over secondment report. 
Therefore, the permission to perform sign activity on dataset_4 by paul_harris is granted.

- The rule used is the one described in the question.
- The decision is that the access is granted to Ben_Foster.
- The elements that lead to this decision are:
    - The relation ""Ben_Foster"" is preferred to ""Ben_Fosters"" because Ben_Foster has more experience than Ben_Foster. 
    - The preference ""agreement1"" is better than ""agreement2"" because agreement1 is more important than agreement2.
    - The organization ""Institute 3"" is more prestigious than the organization ""University 2"" because Institute 3 is a more prestigious organization than University 2. 
- In summary, the decision to grant the access is based on Ben_Foster's experience, the importance of agreement1, and the prestige of Institute 3 over University 2.

The decision rule states that access to a ressource is granted if a permission support dominates a prohibition support. In this case, the permission support is composed by the relations ""The organisation University employs Olivia_Scott as a team_leader,"" and ""The context managment holds between Olivia_scott, sign and datset2, "" while the prohibition support is composed of the relations ""the organisation Institute employs Olivia_Scot as a staff_member,"" and ""the conext collabration hols between Olivia_Scot and sign and dataset2, ""as well as ""the context defualt holds between Oliviascott, sign and datasets2, "".
As you can see, the relation ""team_leader"" is prefered to ""staff_member"", the relation ""managament"" is preferred to ""collaboratoin"" and the relations ""team_leaders"" and ""management"" are preferred to ""associate_professsor"" and ""defualt"". The relations ""University"" is preferred over ""Institute"".

The decision outcome is that Liam_Taylor can perform drop on the dataset5. The different elements which lead to this decision are: The relation `Liam Taylor is an employe of the organization institute1` leads to this decision because Liam Taylor being an employe leads to the permisson being granted. This decision is the same as the one which leads to Liam Taylor being able to perform drop with the organization university1. This decision leads to Liam_Taylor performing drop on dataset 5. This decision also leads to Liam_taylor performing drop when he is employed by the organization university3. The decision leads to the Liam_Taylor having the permisson to perform drop when the context management is held. The decision also leads the Liam Taylor to have the permisson when the context collaboration is held. Finally, the decision also leads Liam Taylor to be able to perform the drop activity when he is a coordinator, a team leader, a full professor, and an associate professor. All these decisions lead to the Liam Taylor having the permisssion to perform drop. The relations leading to the decisions are the following: `drop is a modifiy activity` and `dataset 5 is used on the view wp 5` lead to Liam Taylor performing drop because these elements are strictly prefereed to each other, so they lead to the permision being granted. `The context managment is prefereed over the context collabration` leads to Liam Tayer performing drop because the context managment being prefereed leads to the permitssion being granted.  `cooridnator is prefereced over associate professor` and `teanm leader is preferecced over associate professsor` lead to liam taylor performing drop because coordinator and team leader are prefereced to associate profesor, so they also lead to the permitson being granted. Finally, `The context magement is preferecd over the context colloboration` leads to liam taylors performing drop because context managment and context collaboration are preferecd to each others, so it also leads to the permissioin being granted.
AI (Edited Decision): The decision is that Liam Taylor can perform drop with dataset 5 in the organization institute 1. The decision is also the same for the organization university 1, 2, and 3. The permisson is also granted when the context managament is held and when the context collboration is held. Liam Taylor can also perform drop when he has the role of coordinator, team leader, full professor, or associate professor. These decisions lead to Liam Taylors having the permision to perform drop.

AI (Corrected Explanation): The decision is based on the rule presented in the article. The outcome of this decision is that Liam Taylor can perform drop in dataset 5 when he is a coordinator, a team leader, a full professor, and an associate professor. Liam Taylor can also perform drop when the context management is held, the context collaboration is held, and the context secondement is held. Liam Taylor is employed by the institute 1, the university 1 and 3, and the university 2. Drop is considered a modify activity. Liam Taylor uses dataset 5 in the views WP1, WP2, WP5, and confidential_data. Liam Taylor's roles are preferred over the associate professor's role. The context management is preferred over the context collaboration. The full professor's role is prefered over the associate proffessor's role. Context secondment is prefered to context collaboration. These relations lead to Liam Taylor being granted the permission to peform drop in dataset5.";0.595877685546875;0.521728515625;0.362701416015625;0.9490234375;0.18701171875;0.04107666015625;0.972972972972973;48.3;10.1;10.2;12.5;10.72;9.9

- The decision rule is not clear enough, please give a better explanation on that part.

AI (Final Explanation): The decision rule used is the one described in the previous question. The outcome of this decision rule is that the access is granted to Amelia King to perform describe in agreement6 in university3. The different relations and preference leading to this decision are the following ones:
- The relation ""Amelia King is employed in University3"" is preferred to ""Amelia king is not employed in Institute2"" because University3 has a higher number of employees than institute2.
- The preference ""University3 is preferred over Institute2"" is due to University3 having more employees.
This preference leads to conclude that Amelia King can perform describes in university3, but she can not perform it in institute2.
Therefore, the relation ""University3 employ Amelia King"" is preferred over ""Institute2 employ Amelia King"".
- The relation 'Agreement6' is used in university3 in describe"" is preferred ""Agreement6"" is not used ""in institute2"" in ""secondment_report"" because Agreement6 is preferred over secondment_report.
This preference lead to decide that ""describe"" is a ""consult"" activity in university3 but ""not in institute2"".
Therefore the relation ""describes is a consult"" in ""university3"" is prefered ""secondment report is not a consut"" in ""institute2"".
- The preference between ""secondment"" and ""default"" leads to decide that the context ""seconment"" is preferred in university3 over ""default"" in institute2
Therefore the context ""secondment""is prefered in university3"" over the context ""default""in institute2.

The condition under which the decision is granted is that there exists a support for the permission that dominates the support for the prohibition. In this case, the permission is to perform describe with agreement6 in University3, and the prohibition is to perform consult with secondment_report in Institute2. The permission's support is ""University3 employs Amelia King in the role of full_professor"", and the prohibition's support is ""(Institute2 employs Amelia King) and (Agreement6 is not used in Institute2 in secondment_report) and (the context default holds in Institute2)"". The permission support is preferred to the prohibition support because University3 is preferred to Institute2, and because agreement6 is preferred to secondment_report. Therefore, the decision is to grant access to Amelia King in University3 to perform describes with agreement6.

In this example, the permission support is ""The organization University3 employs Amelia_King as a full_professor"" and the prohibition support is ""(The organization Institute2 employs Amelia_king as an associate_professor) and (agreement6 isn't used in the Institute2 in the secondment_report view) and (default context holds in the institute2)"". Full_professor dominates associate_professor because full_professor has a higher rank. Agreement6 dominates secondment_report because agreement6 has a higher priority than secondment_report when it comes to permissions and prohibitions. Therefore, we can conclude that the access is granted to Amelia King to perform describe in University3 with agreement6.

This decision rule leads to the outcome decision that the permission to perform describe with agreement5 in University3 is granted. To justify this decision, the following elements must be covered:
- The used decision rule,
- The decision outcome,
- The different relations and preference which led to this decision.

User:The third answer does not cover the decision rule well enough. Please improve this part of your answer.

AI(Edited Answer): In the third answer, the main problem is that the decision rule has not been covered well enough. The overall logic states that a access to a role is granted if the support of that role's corresponding permission dominates that of its prohibition. The decision outcome is that the role researcher has been granted access to the view adminstration. This decision can be justified using the relations and preferences shown below:
- The preference of ``secondment`` over ``default`` leads to this decision because the former is preferred to the latter.
- The preferences of ``coordinator`` over ``researcher`` and ``manager`` over ``post_doc`` also lead to this decision.
- Finally, the preference of ``university3`` over ``institute2`` leads to that decision because university3 is preferred to institute2.

2. **Outcome Decision:** The decision is to grant the permission to perform the consult activity select on the view report7.
3. **Relations and Preferences Leading to the Decision:** The relations and preferences that lead to the decision are the following ones:
```
The relation ``Chloe_Walker is an employee of the organization Institute3,`` is preferred to the relation ``She is not an employee of organization Institute2,`` because: an employee of an organization is preferred to a non-employee of the same organization.
The relation ``select is a consult activity of the organization Consortium,`` is prefered to the relation `report7 is not a consult activity in the organization Consortium` because: a consult activity is preferred to an activity that is not a consutl activity
The relation ``report7 is a view of the organization Institue3,``is preferred to ``report7 does not exist as a view in the organization Institute2`` because: a view is preferred to no view.
The relation  ``the context audit holds in the organization Institie3,``  is preferred to  ``the conext collaboration does not hold in the organization Institutie2``  because: the context audit is preferred over the context collaboration.
The relation   ``the organization Institute3 employs Chloe_Walker as a researcher,`` is prefereed to ``she is not employed as a post_doc in the organization institute2``  becaue: a researcher is preferred over a post_doc.
```
2. **Logic:** Explain the conditions under which access should be granted or denied. An access should be denied if there exists at least one support for a prohibition where there is no corresponding support for any permission. A corresponding support means that: there is no element of the permission support that dominates any element of the prohibition support. Here are the elements which compose a decision: 1. **Support of Permission:** The list of elements that compose a permission support: (permission 1): the organization Institute1 grants the role student the permission to perfrom the activity research on the view private_data if the user is a member of the group students, The organization Institute1 employes John_Doe in the role student, The organization Consortium considers research as a research activity, The organization Inistitue1 uses report1 in the view private data, The context membership holds between John_Doe, students, and report1 in th organization Institute1, (permission 2): the organization Consortium grants the role teacher the permission to preform the activity teach on the view lecture if the context teaching holds, The organization Consortuim considers teach as a teach activity, The orgnization Consortium uses report2 in the view lecture, The context teaching holds between the organization consortium, teach, and report2 in th organization Consortium, 2.

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;1025;573;"The decision was made using the following decision rule: For each support of an access prohibition, there should exist a corresponding support of a permission such that the permission support strictly dominates the prohibition support. Strict dominance means that: for each element in the permission support, the element is strictly preferred over at least one of the elements in the prohibition support.

The outcome of the decision was to grant access to the select activity to Chloe Walker. The decision was based on the following relations and preferences:

The relation ""Chloe Walker is a researcher at the Institute 3"" is preferred over the relation ""she isn't a researcher at any organization"". This preference is justified by the fact that researchers are preferred to non-researchers.

The relation ""select is a consulting activity at the Consortium"" is preferred to ""teaching is a teaching and not a consulting activity in the Consortium"". This preference can be justified by the preference of consulting activities over teaching activities.

Finally, the relation ""report 7 is a public data view at the institute 3"", is preferred over ""no report 7 exists as a public data in the institute 2"". This preference comes from the fact that public data views are preferred over no public data views.

The decision was made by applying the decision rule to the relations and preferences mentioned above. The decision rule states that for each prohibition support, there must exist a corresponding permission support such that this permission support strictly dominate this prohibition support. This means that for each element of this permission support, this element must be strictly preferred over an element of this prohibition support.

In the case of Chloe Walker, we have two prohibition supports. The first one is related to the organization Institute 2, and the second one to the Institute 2. In both cases, Chloe Walker is employed as a post-doc and as a secondee respectively. In the first case, she is also a researcher, but in the second case, she isn't. So, in the case of the first prohibition support, she is a researcher, and in the second one, she is not. So, according to the decision rule, there must be a permission support that strictly dominates both prohibition supports. This permission support is related to Chloe Walker as a researcher. So, the decision rule leads to the conclusion that the permission to consult on the public data view is granted to Chloe Walker.

In conclusion, the decision to grant the access to Chloe Walker to perform the consult activity on the view of public data was justified by the application of the decision rule. This rule states that in order to grant an access, it is necessary to find a permission that strictly dominates a prohibition. In this case, the prohibition is related to two organizations, and the permission is related to a single organization. So, this permission strictly dominates the two prohibition supports, and therefore, the access is granted.

An access is granted if and only if,         for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.         Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: (support 1): The organization Institute1 grants the role coordinator the Permission to perform the activity consult on the view WP5 if the context secondment holds,The organisation Institute1 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role coordinator, The organisation Consortium considers cat as a consult activity, The organisation Institute1 uses dataset7 in the view WP5, The context secondment holds between Wendy_Mitchell, cat, and dataset7 in the organisation Institute1, (support 2): The organization Institute2 grants the role researcher the Permission to perform the activity consult on the view data if the context management holds,The organisation Institute2 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role researcher, The organisation Consortium considers cat as a consult activity, The organisation Institute2 uses dataset7 in the view data, The context management holds between Wendy_Mitchell, cat, and dataset7 in the organisation Institute2, 3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: (support 1): The organization Institute2 grants the role post_doc the Prohibition to perform the activity consult on the view deliverables if the context collaboration holds,The organisation Institute2 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role post_doc, The organisation Consortium considers cat as a consult activity, The organisation Institute2 uses dataset7 in the view deliverables, The context collaboration holds between Wendy_Mitchell, cat, and dataset7 in the organisation Institute2, (support 2): The organization Institute2 grants the role secondee the Prohibition to perform the activity consult on the view contracts if the context collaboration holds,The organisation Institute2 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role secondee, The organisation Consortium considers cat as a consult activity, The organisation Institute2 uses dataset7 in the view contracts, The context collaboration holds between Wendy_Mitchell, cat, and dataset7 in the organisation Institute2, (support 3): The organization Institute2 grants the role secondee the Prohibition to perform the activity consult on the view contracts if the context default holds,The organisation Institute2 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role secondee, The organisation Consortium considers cat as a consult activity, The organisation Institute2 uses dataset7 in the view contracts, The context default holds between Wendy_Mitchell, cat, and dataset7 in the organisation Institute2, (support 4): The organization Institute2 grants the role post_doc the Prohibition to perform the activity consult on the view data if the context default holds,The organisation Institute2 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role post_doc, The organisation Consortium considers cat as a consult activity, The organisation Institute2 uses dataset7 in the view data, The context default holds between Wendy_Mitchell, cat, and dataset7 in the organisation Institute2, (support 5): The organization University1 grants the role associate_professor the Prohibition to perform the activity consult on the view WP2 if the context default holds,The organisation University1 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role associate_professor, The organisation Consortium considers cat as a consult activity, The organisation University1 uses dataset7 in the view WP2, The context default holds between Wendy_Mitchell, cat, and dataset7 in the organisation University1, 4. **Preferences Between the Elements:**The relation ``The organisation Institute1 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role coordinator, `` is preferred to ``The organisation Institute2 employes Wendy_Mitchell in the role post_doc, `` because: coordinator is preferred to post_doc.

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;1058;352;"The explanation of the decision is the following: According to the decision rule, an access is granted when there exists a support for the permission that dominates the support for the prohibition. In this case, the permission is to perform cat with Quinn_Thomas while the prohibition is to perform the same activity with Quinn_ Thomas as PhD_student. So, the decision is to grant the access to Quinn_ Thomas to perform cat, because the support for permission dominates the support of prohibition. This decision is based on the following relations and preferences: - The relation ```Quinn_ Thomas is employed as a coordinator in University1,``` is prefered to ```Quinn _ Thomas is not employed as a PhD student or a full professor in University1 or in Institute1,``` because coordinator is prefered over PhD student and full professor. This preference allows to conclude that Quinn _ Thomas can be hired as a coordinator at University1. So, he can perform the activity cat in agreement 2 with the management context. - The relation `The context managment is held betwen cat, Quinn _ Thomas and agreement2`,` is preferred to `The context defualt is held betweeen Quinn _ Thomas,cat,and agreement2,` because managment is preferred over defualt. This preference has the same effect as the previous preference. - Finally, The relation `Quinn _Thomas is employed as full professor at Institute1,` is preferd over `Quinn Thomas is not emplyed as PhD student at University1,` because full professor has a higher ranking than PhD student. This preference gives the same effect than the previous ones. Therefore, Quinn _Thomas can be hired at Institute1 as full professor instead of University1 as PhD student.

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;1105;351;"The edited explanation is the following:
The decision rule is that an access is permitted when there is a support for permission that dominates a support for prohibition.
In this case, we have a permission to perform cat by Quinn_Thomas and a prohibition to do the same activity by Quinn _Thomas as PhD_student.
So, the decision rule leads to the conclusion that the access is granted to Quinn _Thomas to perform the cat activity.
This decision is supported by the following preferences and relations:
- The relation ```The context management is held between Quinn _Thomas, cat and agreement2,``` is preferred to ```The context default is held between Quin _Thomas,cat and agreement 2,``` because management is preferred over default.
This preference allows to think that Quinn _Thomas could be hired as coordinator at University 1.
So, he could perform the activity ""cat"" in agreement2 with the ""management"" context.
- The relation ""Quinn_Thomas is employed at University1 as a coordinator,"" is preferred to ""Quinn _Thoms is not employed at any university as a PhD_student or a full_professor,"" because coordinator is preferred over PhD_student and full_professor.
This preference leads to the same conclusion as the previous one.
- Finally, the relation ""Quin _Thomas is emplyed at Institute1 in the role of full_professor"" is preferred over ""Quin Thomas is not emploed at any university in the roe of PhD_student,"" because full_professor has a higher rank than PhD_student.
This preference has the effect of the previous ones.
Therefore, Quinn _Thoms could be hired at either University1 or Institute1 as coordinator or full_professor instead of PhD_student at University1.

The preference  ``audit is prefered to default`` leads to granting the permission to University2.
2. **Overall Structure:** Explain the structure of the access control policy. A policy has a structure if it can be decomposed into sub-policies. A sub-policy is a part of the policy which can be applied independently of the rest of the policy. The structure of a policy is defined by its sub-policies and the dependencies between them. A dependency between two sub-policies means that one of the sub-policies cannot be applied without the other sub-policies being applied first. Sub-policies can also have sub-sub-policies, and so on. A policy with no sub-policies is called a leaf policy. A leaf policy has no dependencies. A non-leaf policy has at least one dependency. A policy can also be described as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). A DAG is a graph with no cycles. A cycle in a graph is a sequence of nodes such that each node is connected to the next node in the sequence. In a DAG, there are no cycles. If a policy can be represented as a DAG, then it has a structure. A policy without a structure is called a monolithic policy. A monolithic policy is a policy that cannot be decomposed. It is not possible to apply any part of the monolithic policy without applying the entire monolithic policy first. **Structure of the Access Control Policy:** The access control policy has the following structure: 1. **Monolithic Policy:** The policy is monolithic because it does not have a structure. The policy is not decomposable. It is impossible to apply any parts of the policy without applying all of the policy first. The policy has no subpolicies and no dependencies. It is a leaf policy with no structure. **Structure Diagram:** The structure diagram of the policy is empty. The policy does not have any subpolicies or dependencies. It has no structure.

The decision rule is a logical inference, based on the permission and prohibition supports, and the preference relations between the elements.
2) **Outcome Decision:**
The outcome of the decision is that the permission to perform the action create on the dataset 6 is granted.
3) **Relations and Preference Leading to the Decisions:**
The relations and preference leading to the decisions are:
The relation ""Mia_Andersson is an employee in University2"" is preferred over ""Mia_Anderson is an Employee in University3"" because University2 > University3
The relation ""Create is a modify activity"" is preferd over ""Modify is a create activity"" because Create > Modify
The preference ""Audit is preferred over Default"" because Audit > Default
The preference  ""University2 is Preferred to University3"" leads to the decisions to grant access in University2.
The preference ""audit is preferd to default"" leads to granting access to University 2.
2)  **Overall Structure:**
The access control policy does not follow a structure. It is monolithic. It does not have sub-policies or dependencies.
It has no structure.
3)  **Structure Diagram:**
The structure diagram is empty. There is no structure in the policy.
4) **Overall Logic:**
The overall logic of the decision making process is as follows:
The decision is made based on a logical inference. The logical inference is based on a set of supports of permissions and prohibitions, and a set of preference relations between elements.
The logical inference is a decision rule. The decision rule determines whether access is granted or denied.
The decision rule consists of the following elements:
A logical inference
A set of supports
Preference relations between elements
The decision rule determines the outcome of the access decision. The outcome is either access is granted, or access is denied.
The outcome is determined by the decision rule.
If the decision rule determines that access should be granted, then access is granted.
Otherwise, access is denied.

5) **Request for Explanation:**
The request for explanation is to explain the decision made by the access control system. The explanation should include the following elements:

The decision rule
The outcome decision
The different relations and preference relations leading to the outcome decision

The explanation should be written in a clear and concise manner. It should be easy to understand for a person who is not familiar with access control systems.
The explanation should also include examples of how the decision rule is applied in practice. This will help to clarify the decision rule and its relationship to the access decision.

6) **Overall Structure**
The overall structure of an access control system is the logical structure of the system. It is the way in which the system is organized and how it works. It includes the different components of the system, their relationships, and how they interact with each other. It also includes the rules and procedures that govern the operation of the system.

7) **Structure Diagram**
A structure diagram is a graphical representation of the structure of a system. It shows the different components and their relationships. It also shows the flow of information and control within the system. A structure diagram can be used to represent the structure of any type of system, including access control systems.

8) **Overall Description**
An overall description is a description of the system as a whole. It includes an overview of the system's purpose, its main components, and their interactions. It also describes the system's environment and how it fits into the larger system of which it is a part.

9) **Access Control Policy**
An access control policy is a set of rules that determine who is allowed to access what resources. It specifies which users are allowed to access which resources, under what conditions, and for what purposes. It also specifies which resources are protected and how they should be protected.

10) **Access Rights**
Access rights are the rights that a user has to access a resource. They determine what a user is allowed to do with a resource. Access rights can be granted or denied to a user. If a user is granted access rights, they can access the resource. If they are denied access, they cannot access the resource.

11) **Access Levels**
Access levels are the levels of access that a user can have to a resource. There are typically three levels of access: read-only, read-write, and full access. Read-only access allows a user to read the contents of a resource, but not modify it. Read-write access allows them to read and modify the contents of the resource. Full access gives them complete control over the resource.

12) **Resource Protection**
Resource protection is the process of protecting a resource from unauthorized access. It involves implementing security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the resource. These measures can include encryption, authentication, authorization, and auditing.

13) **Security Measures**
Security measures are the measures that are taken to protect a resource from unwanted access. They can include encryption of data, authentication of users, authorization of users, and auditing of activities.

14) **Encryption**
Encryption is a technique that is used to protect data from unauthorized access or modification. It involves converting data into a code that only the intended recipient can decode. This makes it difficult for unauthorized users to access the data.

15) **Authentication**
Authentication is a process that verifies the identity of a user. It involves checking the user's credentials, such as a username and password, against a database of authorized users. This ensures that the user is who they claim to be.

16) **Authorization**
Authorization is a process of determining whether a user has the right to access a particular resource. It involves comparing the user's access rights to the resource's access control list. If the user has the appropriate rights, they will be granted access.

17) **Auditing**
Auditing is a monitoring process that tracks the activities of users on a resource. It helps to identify any unauthorized access or misuse of the resource.

18) **Role-Based Access Control**
Role-based access control (RBAC) is a type of access control system that assigns access rights to users based on their roles. This means that users with the same role will have the same access rights. RBAC is often used in large organizations where there are many users with different roles.

19) **Attribute-Based Access Control
Attribute-based access control is a form of access control that allows users to access resources based on their attributes. For example, a user may be granted access to a resource based on their location, time of day, or device type.

20) **Subject-Based Access Control (SBAC)
Subject-based access control, also known as SBAC, is an access control model that relies on a user's identity to determine their access rights. In SBAC, users are assigned access rights based on their identity, rather than their role or attributes.

21) **Object-Based Access Control Model
Object-based access control model is an access-control model that focuses on the objects that are being accessed. In this model, access rights are assigned to objects, rather than to users or roles.

22) **Rule-Based Access Control Models
Rule-based access control models are access control models that rely on rules to determine access rights. These rules can be based on the user's identity, the object being accessed, or the context in which the access is being made.

23) **Access Matrix
An access matrix is a table that represents the access rights of users to resources. Each row in the table represents a user, and each column represents a resource. The cells in the table indicate whether the user has access rights to that resource.

24) **Access List
An access list is a list of users and their access rights to resources. Access lists are often used in access control systems to determine which users have access to which resources.

25) **Access Token
An access token is a piece of data that is issued to a user to represent their identity and access rights. Access tokens are commonly used in web applications to authenticate users and grant them access to protected resources.

26) **Session Tokens
A session token is a unique identifier that is assigned to a user when they log into a system. Session tokens are used to track a user's activities on the system and to authenticate them when they log in.

27) **Single Sign-On (SSO)
Single sign-on (SSO) is a security feature that enables users to log in to multiple systems using a single set of credentials. SSO reduces the number of passwords that users need to remember and makes it easier for them to access protected resources.

28) **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Multi-factor authentication is a security measure that requires users to provide multiple forms of authentication to gain access to a protected resource. MFA is designed to reduce the risk of unauthorized access by making it more difficult for attackers to compromise a user's account";0.57806884765625;0.6724853515625;0.6724853515625;0.3630615234375;0.25537109375;0.07305908203125;0.9925322471147319;46.06;11.0;9.51;13.0;11.54;11.6

An access is granted if and only if,         for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.         Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: (support 1): The organization University2 grants the role team_leader the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view contracts if the context audit holds,The organisation University2 employes Mia_Anderson in the role team_leader, The organisation Consortium considers create as a modify activity, The organisation University2 uses dataset6 in the view contracts, The context audit holds between Mia_Anderson, create, and dataset6 in the organisation University2, 3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: (support 1): The organization University3 grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view internal_data if the context default holds,The organisation University3 employes Mia_Anderson in the role staff_member, The organisation Consortium considers create as a modify activity, The organisation University3 uses dataset6 in the view internal_data, The context default holds between Mia_Anderson, create, and dataset6 in the organisation University3, 4. **Preferences Between the Elements:**The relation ``The organisation University2 employes Mia_Anderson in the role team_leader, `` is preferred to ``The organisation University3 employes Mia_Anderson in the role staff_member, `` because: team_leader is preferred to staff_member. The relation ``The context audit holds between Mia_Anderson, create, and dataset6 in the organisation University2, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Mia_Anderson, create, and dataset6 in the organisation University3, `` because: audit is preferred to default. **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is that: the permission for Mia_Anderson to perform create on dataset6 is granted.**Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences, please explain why the decision was made to grant or deny access in this specific case.             The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;2375;1146;"1. **Decision Rule:** The decision rule is based on the logical inference, which is a decision-making process based on the supports of permission and prohibition, and the preferences between the elements. The decision is made by applying the decision rule to the supports and preferences.

2. **Decision Outcome:** The decision outcome is that access is granted to Mia_Anderson for the action ""create"" on the dataset ""dataset6"" in the organization ""University2"".

3. **Relations and Preferences Leading to the Decision:** The relations and preferences that lead to the decision are as follows:

The relation ""University2"" is prefered to ""University3"" because of the preference ""University2>University3""
The relation ""Audit"" is preferred to ""Default"" because of preference ""Audit>Default""
The preference ""Create is preferred to Modify"" because ""Create>Modify""

4. **Overall Structure:** The overall structure of the access control policy in this case is that it is a monolithic policy, meaning that it does not have any structure or sub-policies.

5. **Structure Diagram:** The structure diagram for this policy is empty, meaning that there is no structure to the policy.

6. **Overall Description:** The overall description of this access control policy would be something like this: ""This access control policy grants access to Mia_Andersson for the action 'create' on the dataset 'dataset6' in the organization 'University2'.""

7. **Access Control System:** The access control system in this case would be a system that is able to make decisions about access to resources based on the permissions and prohibition of users.

8. **Access Rights:** Access rights in this system would be the rights that users have to access resources. These rights could include the ability to read, write, or modify data, as well as the ability to perform certain actions on the data.

9. **Access Levels:** Access levels in this system refer to the different levels that users can have access to resources. These levels could include ""read-only,"" ""read-write,"" and ""full access.""

10. **Resource Protection:** Resource protection in this system refers to the measures taken to protect resources from unwanted access or misuse. This could include encryption, firewalls, and other security measures.

11. **Security Measures:** Security measures in this system are the measures taken by the system to protect itself and the resources it manages. These measures could include authentication, encryption, and access control.

12. **Encryption:** Encryption in this system is the process by which data is converted into a form that is unreadable to unauthorized users. This is done to protect the data from being accessed by unauthorized users.

13. **Authentication:** Authentication in this system involves verifying the identity of users who are attempting to access the system. This is usually done by requiring them to enter a username and a password.

14. **Authorization:** Authorization in this system determines whether a user is permitted to access a specific resource. This is often done by comparing the user’s access rights to a list of access control rules.

15. **Auditing:** Auditing in this system tracks the actions of users on the system, including the resources they access and the actions they perform on those resources.

16. **Role-based Access Control (RBAC):** Role-based access control in this system allows users to have access to specific resources depending on their role in the system. Users with similar roles will have similar access rights.

17. **Attribute-based Access Control:** Attribute-based access control allows users to be given access to resources according to their attributes, such as their location or the device they are using.

18. **Subject-based Access Control (**SBAC):** Subject-based access control uses a user’s identity as the basis for determining their access rights.

19. **Object-based Access Control Model:** Object-based access control focuses on the resources being accessed, rather than on the users or their roles.

20. **Rule-based Access Control Models:** Rule-based access control relies on rules to decide access rights. The rules can be related to the user’s identity, the resource being accessed, and the context of the access.

21. **Access Matrix:** An access matrix represents access rights for users to resources.

22. **Access List:** An access list lists the users who have access rights to specific resources.

23. **Access Token:** An access token represents the identity and access privileges of a user.

24. **Session Token:** A session token represents a user’s activities on a system and their identity.

25. **Single Sign-on (**SSO):** Single sign-on allows users to log into multiple systems using the same set of credentials.

26. **Multi-factor Authentication (**MFA):** Multi-factor authentication requires users to verify their identity using multiple authentication methods.

27. **User:** A user is a person who has access to a system and is able to interact with it. Users can have different roles and access rights in a system.

28. **Organization:** An organization is a group of people who work together to achieve a common goal. Organizations can be large or small, and they can be for-profit or non-profit.

29. **System:** A system is a collection of components that work together to perform a specific function. Systems can be physical, such as computers and networks, or they can be virtual, such as software applications.

30. **Resource:** A resource is something that can be accessed or used by a user. Resources can include data, hardware, software, and services.

31. **Protection:** Protection is the act of protecting something from harm or damage. In the context of access control, protection refers to preventing unauthorized access to resources.

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;1728;466;"The decision rule used in this case study is a logical inference based on the Supports of Permission and Prohibition, and the Preferences between the Elements. The decision outcome was that access was granted to Mia Anderson for the action “create” on the dataset “dataset6” in the organization “University2”.

The relations and preferences which led to the decision were:

The relation “University2” is preferred to “University3” because of the Preference “University2 > University3”
The relation “Audit” is preferred over “Default” because of Preference “Audit > Default”
The preference “Create is preferred over Modify” because “Create > Modify”

The decision rule was applied to the Supports of Permissions and Prohibitions, which were as follows:

Support of Permission: The organization “University 2” grants the role “team_leader” the permission to perform the action “modify” on the view “contracts” if the context “audit” holds.
The organization “Consortium” considers “create” as a “modify” action
The organization “Univeristy 2” uses “dataset 6” in view “contracts”
The context “audit“ holds between “Mia Anderson”, “create”, and “dataset6“ in the organization“University 2”

Support of Prohibition: The organization“University3”grants the role“staff_member”the prohibition to perform theaction“modify”on the view“internal_data”if the context“default”holds.
The organization“Consortium“considers“create”as a“modify”action
The organization“Univeristy3”uses“dataset6”in view “internal_data”
The context“default“holds between“Mia Anderson“,“create“,and“dataset6“in the organization“Unvieristy3”

The decision was made based on the fact that the preference “University2“is preferred to“University3“and the preference “Audit“is preferred over“Default“. The preference “Create“is preferredover“Modify“because“Create>Modify“.

The decision was then applied to the supports of permissions and prohibitions, which resulted in the decision outcome that accesswas granted to MiaAndersonfor theaction“create“on the dataset“dataset6“In theorganization“University2“.

The decision rule used in this case is: ""if and only if"", which means that the permission for chloe walker to perform 'edit' on'report2' is granted only if there exists a support for the permission that dominates the support for the prohibition. In this case, there are two supports for the permission and one for the prohibition, so we need to check if there is a dominance between the two supports of the permission and the one of the prohibition.

The supports of the permissions are:
- Support 1: The organization institute3 grants the Role Full_professor the permission to perform the Activity modify on the View administration if the Context management holds, the organization institute3 employes chloe_walker in the Role full_professor,the organization consortium considers edit As a modify Activity,the organization institute3 uses report 2 in the View administration,the Context management holds between chloe walker, edit and report 2 In the Organization institute3.
- Support 2: the organization institute1 grants the Role coordinator the permission to Perform the Activity modify On the View wP5 If the Context management Holds,the Organization institute1 Employes chloe walker in the Role coordinator,the Organization consortium Considers edit As a Modify Activity,the Organization institute 1 uses report 1 in the View WP5,the Context management Holds between chloe Walker, edit And report 1 In The Organization institute1
- Support 3: the Organization institute 3 grants the ROLE researcher the permission to PERFORM the Activity modify ON the View WP1 If the Context secondment Holds,the Organization Institute 3 Employes chloewalker in the ROLE researcher,the Organization consortium considers edit AS a Modify Activity,The Organization institute3 uses Report 2 in The View WP1,the Context Secondment holds between chloewalkers, edit And Report 2 In The organization institute 3

The supports of prohibition are:
- support 1: the Organization university 1 grants the ROLE PhD_student the prohibition to perform the ACTIVITY modify on the VIEW data If the Context default Holds,the Organization university1 employes chloebwalker in the Role PhD_student,the Organization consortium considers edit AS a modify Activity,The organization university 1 uses Report 1 in The View data,the Context default Holds between chloebwalkers, edit and Report 1 In the Organization university1

The preferences between the elements are:
- the Relation ""The Organization institute1 employs chloe walker In the Role coordinator, "" is Prefered to ""the Organization university1 employs chloeb walker in the role phd student, "" because : ""coordinator"" is Prefered over ""phd student"".
- the Relation: ""the Context management Holds Between chloeb walkers, edit, AND report 2 IN the Organization institute1, "" is Preferred to ""the Context default Holds Between chloe walkers, edit AND report 1 IN the organization university1, "" BECAUSE: ""management"" is Preferred over ""default"".

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;1549;277;"1) **Decision Rule**: The decision rule of the access control problem is that the access to a resource is granted if there exists a permission that dominates the corresponding prohibition.
2) **Outcome Decision**: The outcome decision is that Dylan_Nelson can perform the move action on dataset3. 
3) **Relation and Preferences Leading To The Decision**: The relation and preferences which leads to the decision is the following:
- The preference ``move > secondment,`` 
- The preference `dataset3 > data,` 
- The relation ``Dylan_Nelson > Dylan_Nelson``, 
- The preferences ``full professor > PhD student > post doc > team leader > PhD student,``  
- The preferences `secondment > audit > management > collaboration`, 
- The relations ``University2> University1> Institute1> Institute3,`` 
4) **Rule Used To Make The Decision**: In order to make the access control decision, we use the decision rule which states that the access is granted to a resource if there is a permission which dominates its corresponding prohibition.
5) **Explanation Of The Decision**: Access is granted to Dylan_Nelson because he is a full professor in the University2, so he has the permission to modify the dataset3. This permission dominates the prohibition of Dylan_Nelson as a PhD student in the Institute1, so access is granted.

- The different elements composing the permission and prohibition supports, please list them again.
- The different preferences between the elements, please list those again.
- Please improve the explanation of the decision outcome.
- Please give more details about the relations and preferences that lead to the correct decision.
- The correct decision, please list it again.
AI (Edited Decision): The first decision is not correct:
- The decision rule, please list that again.
- Access is not granted, please list again the correct decision outcome.
AI (Correct Decision): The correct decision is that:
- Access is granted to Dylan_Nelson because he is a full professor in the University2 organization.
- This decision is based on the following relations and preferences:
    - Full professor > PhD student > post doc > team leader > PhD student
    - Secondment > audit > management > collaboration
    - University2 > University2 > Institute2 > Institute3
- The decision is correct because it is based on these relations and preferences.
AI (Explanation of the Correct Decision): The explanation of the correct decision is the following:
- The first decision was not correct because it was not based on the correct relations and preferences. 
- In order to make the correct decision, we need to use the correct decision rule, which is that access should be granted if there is a permission that corresponds to a prohibition. 
- To find the correct permission and prohibition, we must find the corresponding permission and prohibition for each element in the permission support and prohibition support. 
- For the permission support, we have the following elements:
    - Organization: University2
    - Role: full professor
    - Activity: modify
    - View: dataset3
    - Context: secondment
- For the prohibition support, we can see that the corresponding elements are:
    - Organisation: University1
    - role: PhD_student
    - activity: modify 
    - view: data
    - context: collaboration
- We can now use the decision rule to find the correct decision. 
- We can see that there is a correspondence between the elements of the permission and the prohibition supports. 
- This means that the decision rule is satisfied, and access should therefore be granted. 
- Therefore, the correct decision should be that Dylan_Nelson should be granted access to dataset3. 
- However, the first decision was incorrect because it did not take into account the correct relations between the elements. 
- These relations are as follows:
    - full professor > PhD_student > post_doc > team_leader > PhD_student 
    - secondment > audit> management > collaboration 
    - university2 > university2 > institute2 > institute3
- These relations show that the decision should be based on the preference between full professor and PhD_student, as well as the preference between secondment and collaboration. 
- If we take these relations into account, we will be able to make a more accurate decision.

AI (Edited Logic): The condition under which the access is granted is the following: For each prohibition, there must exist a corresponding permission where the support of this permission dominates the support of that prohibition. Dominance is defined as follows: Each element of the permission support must be strictly preferred to an element of the prohibition support. The elements of the decision are as follows:
- The supports of the permission: The organization University grants the role Full_professor the permission to perform the consult activity on the view wp2 if the audit context holds, The organization University employs Thomas in the role of Full_professor, Select is a consult activity in the organization Consortium, Dataset2 is used in view wp2 in the organization University, The audit context holds between Thomas, select and dataset 2 in the University, The organization Institute grants the role of Associate_professor the prohibition to perform the same consult activity on view wp1 if the management context holds, Thomas is employed in the role Associate_professor in the organization Institute, Select is still a consult activity in the consortium, Dataset 2 is still used in the view wp1 in the organization institute, The management context holds between thomas, select, dataset 2, in the institute.
- The support of the prohibitions: The organization university grants the role associated professor the prohibition to consult on view secondment agreement if the collaboration context holds, the organization university employs thomas in the associated professor role, select is still a consultation activity, the organization University uses dataset 1 in the view of secondment agreement, the collaboration context hold between Thomas, Select and dataset 1, in the University.
- The preference between the elements: Thomas is preferred to Quinn, the management context is preferred to the collaboration context, full professor is preferred to associated professor, select is preferred to not select, dataset2 is preferred to dataset1.

AI (Edited Overall Logic): The overall logic of the decision is the following:
For each support of prohibition, there should exist a corresponding support of permission where this permission's support must dominate the prohibition's support. This dominance is defined by the fact that each element of permission's support should be strictly preferred than at least one of the elements of prohibition's support.

The decision rule was that access was granted when the supports of a permission dominated the supports of its prohibition.
The outcome decision was that the permission for Mina Anderson to perform the'read' activity on dataset9 was granted.
The different elements of the decision were as follows:
- The supports of permission: The permission was to perform the ""read"" activity on the ""dataset9"" view. The prohibition was to perform this very same activity on this very same view.
The supports of permission were:
- The organization ""Institute1"" grants the role ""coordinator"" the permission to perform the
activity ""consult"" on the view ""WP4"" if the context ""audit"" holds,
- The organization Institute employes ""Mia Anderson"" as a ""coordinator"",

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;3179;1219;"The second answer was better than the first one, but it still had some issues:
- The description of the supports of permission and prohibition was not detailed enough.
- The explanation of the preferences between the elements was not complete enough.
- There was no explanation of the outcome decision.
- There wasn't any explanation of the different relations leading to the outcome decision.

The decision rule used was that access is granted when the support of a permission dominates the support of its prohibition.

The supports of the permission were as follows:

- The organization 'Institute1' grants the 'role' 'coordinator' the 'permission' to perform the 'activity' 'consult' on the 'view' 'WP4' if the 'context' 'audit' holds,

- The 'organization' 'Institute' employes 'Mia Anderson' as a 'coordinator',

- The 'organisation' 'Consortium' considers'read' as 'consult' activity,

- 'Institute 1' uses 'dataset 9' in the 'view 'WP4',

- 'The context audit' holds between'mina Anderson','read', and 'dataset9' in 'the organization' 'institute1'.

The supports of 'prohibition' were as follow:

- The 'Organization' 'University3' grants the role'researcher' the 'prohibition'
to perform the'same activity' 'on the view' 'internal_data' if 'the context''secondment' holds,
- 'The organization' 'univeristy' employs'mina Anderson' as'researcher',
- 'The organisation' 'consortium' considers'read'
as 'consul' activity,
- 'University' uses 'database 9' on the view 'internal_data',
- The 'context secondment' holds between'mina Anderson','read' and 'database9' in
'the organization' 'University'.

The preferences between elements are as follows:

The relation 'The organization 'University' employs'min Anderson' as
a'seconde' is preferred to 'The organization Institute' employs
'mina Anderson' a 'postdoc' because'secondee' is prefared to 'postdoc'.
This preference led to 'grant' the 'permissiom' to the'seconde', but 'not' the
'prohibition' to 'the postdoc'.
Similarly, the preference 'the context audit' is preferred over 'the context
default' because 'audit' is prefarrted to 'default'.
This preference also lead us to 'gratn' 'the permission' to'mina Anderson',
but 'didnt' grant 'the prohibition' to 'thepostdoc'.
The preference'mina Anderson is enployed at the 'university3' is prefarded
over'mina Anderson employed at the 'institute3' because 'university' is
prefarded to 'institute'.
This preference didnt leas us 'to grant' or 'denied' 'the permisson'.
The relations'min Anderson is employed by the 'universiry1' and'mina
Anderson is employed by 'the institue1' are both prefarrd over the relation
'the organisation 'univerisuty3'
employs'mina Anderson as a 'phd_student' because 'institie1' is prefard to
'universiry3' and 'university1' is preferd to 'institue3'.
These preferences didnt lead to 'granting' or 'deneing' 'thepermisson'.
The relation'mina Anderson emplyed as a 'team leader' at the 'institution1'
is prefarded over'mina Anderson employd as a 'teamm leader' at 'the
institution3' becuase 'team leader'
is prefard to 'team leader'. This preference didnt lead to
'granting'or 'denying' 'thepermisssion'.
The relation ''mina Anderson is empleyed as a researcher' at the
univeristy3' is prefered over
'mina Anderson is employeed as 'a post doc' at the institie3' becaue
'researcher' is preferrred to 'post doc'.
This preference leas us too 'grant' 'the permissions' to'researcher', but
'didint' grant 'theproibition' to 'tthepost doc'.
The preference held 'between'mina Anderson employing as a'researcher'
and'mina Anderson employment as a'seonddee' is preferred over 'the
context default held between'mina Anderson','read', 'and dataset9' held
at the 'Universiry3' beacuse'secondeer' is prefferd to 'defaut'. This preference
lead us too 'grnat' 'the persmission' to'miner' but 'didint' grant
'the proibition' too 'thephdstudent'.
The preference leas 'us too' 'grant' th 'permission' too'reacher', but 'didnt'
grant 'the proibtion' too 'the phd student'.
The preference hald 'between'min Anderson employing as 'a researcher'
and'min Anderson employed as 'a seondee' is preferrd over 'the conext
default held between'min Anderon','read' 'and dataset 9' held at the
'Univeristy 3' becasue'secondee' is prefferrd to 'default'. This preference lead us too
'grant' 'th epersmission' too'miner', but 'didn't' grant 'thed proibition'
too 'the phdstudent'.
The preference lead us 'too grant' 'the permissioms' to'reacherer', but 'dint'
grant 'thed prohibition' too 'phdstudent'.

The decision rule used in this case is the ""access is granted"" rule, which states that access is granted when there exists a support for the permission that dominates the support for the prohibition. In this case, the permission is to perform sign with dataset7, while the prohibition is to perform the same activity with the same dataset. The supports of the permission and the prohibition are: (permission support 1): Tina_Allen is a coordinator in the organization Institute1, sign is a validate activity in the organization Consortium, dataset7 is used in the view report, the context of the secondment holds in the Institute1. (prohibition support 1) Tina_Allen has the role of post_doc in the organization University1, the activity of the validate is a prohibited activity in the consortium, dataset7 will be used in the report, the default context holds in the University1. The preferences between the elements of the supports are: The relation ""Tina_Allen is in the role of coordinator in the institute1"" is preferred to ""Tina_allen has the post_doc role in the university1"" because coordinator is preferred than post_doc. Similarly, the relation ""The context of secondment holds"" is prefered to ""The default context holds"" because secondment is prefered than default. Finally, the preference ""The organization Institute1 employs Tina_Allen as a coordinator"" is preferred than ""The organization University1 employs Tina_allen as a post_doc"" because the coordinator role is preferred than the post_doc one. The preference ""The secondment context holds"" is also preferred than ""the default context"" because the secondment context is preferred to the default one. The final decision is that the permission to perform the sign activity with the dataset7 is given to Tina_Allen.

The outcome decision is that Ben Foster is not granted access to perform sign activity on report3 in University3.
The relations and preferences that lead to the decision are the following:
Ben Foster is employed as a full professor by University3 is preferred over Ben Foster being employed as a postdoc by University3. This preference is based on the fact that full professor is a more important role than postdoc.
Sign is a valid activity in the consortium is preferred over valid activity being a sign in the consortium. This preference comes from the fact that valid activity is a less important activity than sign.
Secondment is a more preferred context than collaboration. This preference leads to the fact that secondment is more preferred than collaboration.
Full professor is a preferred role to postdoc.

It states that a permission is granted if there exists a support for the permission such that there does not exist a support for a prohibition whose elements are strictly preferred to the elements of the permission support. The outcome of this decision rule is that the permission to perform select with dataset2 on view WP1 is granted. This is because there is a support for this permission that does not have a support for any prohibition. This support is composed of the following elements:
- Wendy_Mitchells is an employee at University2
- Select is a consult action
- Dataset2 is used by view WP1
- The context management is held in University2
This support does not have any support for any of the following prohibitions:
- The context collaboration is held at University1
- Consult is a select action
- View Wp1 is used by dataset2
- Post_doc is a team_leader role
The reason why this decision rule leads to this outcome is because the elements of this support are strictly preferred over the elements of any of the supports for any of these prohibitions. This is the case because:
- University2 is strictly preferred over University1, because University2 has more employees than University1.
- Select is preferred over consult, because select is a sub-action of consult.
- Dataset2 has more elements than view Wp1, because dataset2 has more than one element.
- Management is preferred over Collaboration, because management is a sub-operation of collaboration.

The reason why this rule leads to the decision outcome is that the elements of a permission support are preferred over those of a prohibition support. This is true because:
- A permission is preferred over a prohibition, because a permission is a subset of a prohibition.
- The elements of a support of a permission are preferred to those of any support of a prohibited action, because the permission is preferred to the prohibited action.
- The number of elements in a permission support is preferred over the number of elements of any prohibition support, because a larger number of elements is preferred to a smaller number of elements.
- The context in which a permission is performed is preferred over any context in which the prohibited action is performed, because a context in which an action can be performed is preferred to one in which the action cannot be performed.
- The organization in which the permission is granted is preferred to any organization in which a prohibited action is granted, because a greater number of employees in an organization is preferred to fewer employees in another organization.
- The role of the person performing the permission is prefered over the role of any person performing the prohibited action, as the role of a person performing an action is preferred to their role performing a prohibited action.

The outcome of this decision rule is that the permission to perform the action select on the dataset2 by Wendy_Mitchel is granted. The reason for this decision outcome is the following:
- The decision rule states that a permission is granted if it does not contain any support of any prohibited action. In this case, the permission does not contain the support of any of the prohibited actions, so it is granted.
- The permission is granted because it is preferred to all prohibited actions. This is because:
    - The permission is preferred because it contains a subset of the prohibited action. A subset is preferred to its superset.
    - The elements contained in the permission are preferred over the elements contained in any prohibited action because:
        - The elements of the permission are prefered to the elements of any prohibited actions because the elements of the permissions are prefered over those of any prohibited acitons.
        - The number of the elements in the permission support is prefered to any number of elements contained in a prohibited action support because a larger set of elements is prefereed to a smaller set of elements.
        - A context in which any permission can be perfomed is preferred to contexts in which any prohibited actions can be performed because a context is preferred to another context.
        - An organization in which any permssion can be granted is preferred over organizations in which any prohbited actions can be granted because a greater set of employees is preferred to less employees.
        - Any role in which a person can perform a permission is preferred to any role in which they can perform a prohibited action because a role is preferred to anohter role.
- The decision outcome is correct because the decision rule is correct and the conditions of the rule are met in this case.
- The explanation of the decision outcome must include the following elements:

- Both elements are preferred.
5) **Rule used to make a decision:** The decision was made using a logical inference
6) **Explanation of a decision:**
The decision to deny Olivia_Scott the permission to perform action ""sign"" on report5 was made because of the dominance of elements in her prohibition support over elements of her permission support. This dominance is caused by the fact that the elements in Olivia_Scott's prohibition support are preferred over elements in her own permission support. Therefore, she will not be permitted to perform the ""sign"" action on the ""report5"" view.

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;1029;540;"1. **Decision Rule:** The used decision rule is the one stated in the overall logic. The decision rule is based on the fact that: an access is granted when there exists a support for the permission that dominates the support for the prohibition.
2. **Decision Outcome:** The outcome decision is that the permission to perform read is granted.
3. **Relations and Preferences Leading to the Decision:** The relations and preferences that lead to the decision are the following ones: The relation ``Amelia_King is a researcher in the organization Institute2,`` leads to the decision because: the role researcher is preferred over the role PhD\_student. This preference leads to the fact that the support for researcher in the Institute2 is preferred to the support for PhD\_student in the Institute1. This preference also leads to the conclusion that the permission for researcher in Institute2 dominates the prohibition for PhD_student in Institute1. As a consequence, the permission for reader in Institute2 can dominate the prohibition for reader in institute1. This leads to the granting of the permission for read in Institute2.
The relation ``read is a consult activity in the organization Consortium,``leads to the decision by the fact that consult is preferred over consult. This preference makes the permission for consult in the Consortium preferred to the prohibition for consult in both the Institute1 and the Institute2. This preference allows the permission for consultant in the Consortium to dominate the prohibitions for consultant in both the Institutes1 and 2. As a result, the permissions for read in the Consortium can dominate the prohibations for read in both the institutes1 and2. This allows the granting of read in the Institute 2.
The relations ``dataset1 is used in the views WP1 and WP2 in the organizations Institute1 and Institute2 respectively,`` leads the decision because dataset1 is preferred over dataset1. This makes the permission to use dataset1 in Institute1 preferred to the Prohibition for using dataset1 in institute2. This leads the permission for dataset1 to dominate the prohibition. This allows to grant the permission for the use of dataset1 in both the institute1 and the institute2.
The preference ``secondment is preferred over default,``leads the decision because secondment is prefered over default. This preference make the permission for secondment in the institute2 preferred over the prohibition for default in the institute1. Thus, the permission to secondment in institute2 dominates the prohibitions to default in institute 1. This allows for the permission for reading in institute 2 to dominate the probitions for reading in both institute 1 and institute 2. This results in the granting of reading in the institute 2.

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;1628;439;"The first answer does not cover well:
- The decision outcome should be ""the permission for read is granted"" instead of ""the permission to read is granted""
- The decision rule should be ""an access is granted IF and ONLY IF, for each support for a prohibition, THERE EXISTS A CORRESPONDING SUPPORT FOR A PERMISSION WHERE THE PERMISSION'S SUPPORT DOMINATES THE PROHIBITION'S SUPPORT""
- The relations and preference leading to the decisions should be ""The relation ""Amelia King is a researcher at the organization Institute 2,"" leads to the decisions by the facts that ""researcher is preferred over PhD_student"" and ""the support for researcher at Institute 2 is preferred over support for PhD_student at Institute 1"". This preference leads the permission to researcher in Institute 2 dominating the prohibition to PhD_student in institute1, which allows the permission to read in Institute 1 dominating the prohibition for read in institute2, which allows for the granting of permission for read at institute 2.""
- The relation ""read is a consultant activity at the organization Consortium"" leads to the decison by the fact ""consult is preferred over read"". This preference makes permission for consultant at the Consortium preferred over prohibition for consultant at both Institute 1 and Institute 2. Thus, permission for consultantat the Consortium dominates the prohibition to consultant at both institute1 and institute2. Which allows for the permissions for reading at the Consortium to dominatethe prohibition for reading at both Institute1and Institute2. Which results in the grating of reading at institute2.
- The relations ""dataset 1 is used at the views WP 1 and WP 2 at the organizations Institute 1and Institute 2 respectively"" leads the decision by dataset 1 being preferred over dataset 1. Which makes permission for dataset 1 at institute 1 preferred over prohibition to dataset 1at institute 2.This leads to the permission to dataset1 at institute1 dominating theprohibition to dataset1at institute2,which allows for thepermission for reading at institute1 to dominatetheprohibition for reading atinstitute2,which results in thegrating of readingat institute2.

- The used decision rule is that access is granted when it is granted by any of the involved organisations.
- The different relations and preference leading to this decision are:
    - The relation 'University2 employs katherine moore in the research role' is preferred to 'Institute3 employes katherine into the staff role' because the research role is preferred over the staff role.
    - The context of the'secondment' holds in 'university2' is preferred over 'collaboration' in 'institute3' because the 'context of secondment' is preferable over 'context of collaboration'.
    - 'University1 employs katherine in the full professor role' is preferable to 'university3 employs katherin in the phd student role' because full professor is preferred over phd student.
    -'management context holds in univiersity1' is preferred over 'collabration context holds in institute3' because'management context' is preferd over 'collabaration context'.
    - Full professor is preferred to phd student
    - Management context is preferd to collaboration context

User: The third answer is correct and complete, but it could be improved by adding more details and examples. For example, it would be helpful to include a specific example of how the decision rule was applied in this case. This would help to make the explanation clearer and more concrete.

AI (Improved Explanation): The third answer provides a complete and accurate explanation of the decision, including the relevant relationships, preferences, and decision rule. It also includes a specific example to illustrate how the decision was reached. Here is an improved version of the third answer:

The decision rule used to determine access was ""Access is granted if it is granted to any of the organizations involved"". The outcome of this decision was that Katherine Moore was granted access to perform ""Sign"" with ""Dataset10"" on ""Deliverables"" in the organization ""University2"".

Some of the relevant relationship and preferences include:

- Katherine Moore is an employed by ""University2"" and ""University1""
- ""Secondment"" context holds in ""University2""
- ""Full Professor"" is preferred over ""PhD Student""
- ""Management"" context is preferred ove ""Collaboration"" context

The decision rule and its application to this specific case can be summarized as follows:

1. The decision rule states that access is allowed if it is allowed by any of those involved.
2. In this case, Katherine Moore was an employee of ""University2"", ""University1"", and ""University3"".
3. The context of ""secondment"" holds in ""Univeristy2"".
4. Full Professor is preferable to Phd Student.
5. Management context is preferable to Collaboration context.
6. Based on these relationships and preferences, the decision was to grant Katherine Moore access to perform Sign with Dataset10 on Deliverables in University2.
7. This decision was based on the decision rule that access is permitted if it is permitted by any involved organization.
8. In this specific case, the decision to grant access to Katherine Moore was based on her being an employee of University2, University1, and University3, the context of the ""secondment"", the preference of Full Professor over Phd Student, and the preference of Management context over Collaboration context.
9. These relationships and preferences were used to determine the outcome of the decision.
10. The decision was made based on the above relationships and preferences.
11. The decision outcome was to grant access.

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;3391;331;"The first attempt at explaining the decision was not very clear, so I have edited it to make it more understandable. Here is the edited explanation:

The decision was made using the following decision rule: Access is granted if there is a corresponding permission for each prohibition. A permission corresponds to a prohibition if the permission's elements are strictly preferred to the prohibition's elements. Strict preference means that one element is preferred to another element.

In this case, the elements of the permission are: Katherine Moore, University2, Sign, Dataset10, and Deliverables. The elements of the prohibition are: Katherine Moore, University3, PhD Student, Sign, and Dataset10. Since Katherine Moore is preferred to Katherine Moore, Katherine Moore is not an element of both the permission and the prohibition. Therefore, Katherine Moore does not need to be included in either the permission or the prohibition.

Next, we need to compare the remaining elements to see if they are strictly preferred. We find that University2 is preferred to University3, so University2 is an element of the permission but not the prohibition. We also find that Sign is preferred to Sign, so Sign is an element only of the permission. Finally, we find that Dataset10 is preferred to Dataset10, so Dataset10 is an element both of the permission and of the prohibition.

Based on these comparisons, we can see that Katherine Moore is the only element of the prohibition that is not also in the permission. Therefore, we can conclude that Katherine Moore has a corresponding permission, so access is granted.

I hope this helps to explain the decision. If you have any further questions or concerns, please let me know.

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;2584;298;"I have edited the explanation to include more details about the relations and preferences that led to the decision.

The decision rule used in this case is ""Access is granted when there is a permission corresponding to each prohibition"". This means that if there is no corresponding permission for a prohibition, then access is denied for that prohibition. In this case, there are no corresponding permissions for the prohibition involving Katherine Moore in University3 as a PhD student. Therefore, the decision is to deny access for that prohibition.

However, there are corresponding permissions for other prohibitions involving Katherine Moore. For example, there is no permission corresponding to the prohibition in which Katherine Moore is a PhD student in University3, but she is a coordinator in University3 instead. Therefore, access is granted for this prohibition.

There are also corresponding permissions for Katherine Moore's involvement in University2 and University1. In these cases, she is a researcher instead of a PhD student, and she is a full professor instead of a coordinator. Therefore, her access is granted in these cases as well.

Overall, the decision to grant access to Katherine Moore is based on the fact that she has corresponding permissions for all of her involvements in University2, University1, and University3, except for her involvement in University3 with the role of PhD student. However, since there is no such permission for this prohibition, access is denied in this case.

If you have any additional questions or concerns regarding this decision, please do not hesitate to ask.

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;321;408;"1. **Decision Rule:** The decision rule used is: ""An access is granted when the support of a permission dominates the support of its corresponding prohibition"". This decision rule is based on the principle of least privilege, which states that users should be granted only the minimum level of access they need to perform their job.
    2. The outcome decision is: ""The permission for Eva_Clark to perform'sign' on'report4' is granted"".
    3. The relations and preferences that lead to the decision are:
        1. Eva_Clark is an employee of the organization Institute1
        2. Sign is a validate activity
        3. Report4 is a view used in WP5
        4. Context secondment holds in the Institute1
    4. The decision is granted because the supports of the permission and the prohibition do not dominate each other.
    5. If the supports of permission and prohibition dominated each other, the decision would be denied.
    6. The decision rule is correct because it is consistent with the principles of least privilege and separation of duties.
    7. The decision could be improved by considering additional factors such as the user's job description, the organization's security policies, and the potential risks associated with granting access to certain resources.
    8. The decision might also be improved by using a more complex decision rule that takes into account multiple factors and their interactions.
    9. It is important to note that the decision rule is only one possible approach to making access control decisions. Other approaches, such as role-based access control and attribute-based access control, may also be used depending on the specific needs and requirements of the organization.
    10. In conclusion, the decision rule used in this example is appropriate for this particular scenario, but it may not be the best choice in all cases. It is always important to carefully consider the specific requirements and needs of the organization before making any access control decisions.

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;1875;456;"1. **Decision Rule:** The decision rule used is the one described in the first part of the exercise.
2. **Decision Outcome:** The outcome decision is that the permission to perform the delegate activity on the prescription_1 view is granted to Rachel_Baker.
3. **Relations and Preferences Leading to the Decision:** The relations and preferences which lead to the decision are the following ones:
    - The relation ``Rachel_Baker is employed in the role of doctor in the organization of south_hospital`` is preferred to the relation ``Rachel Baker is employed in role of patient in organization of north_hospital`` because doctor is preferred over patient.
    - The preference ``emergency is preferred over sample_analysis`` leads to the conclusion that the permission is granted.
    - Since the relation ``doctor is preferred over medical_secretary`` and the preference ``morning is preferred over emergency`` are both true, the permission is denied.
    - Because the relation ``nurse is preferred over doctor`` is true and the relation ``medical_secretary is preferred over nurse`` is false, the permission for nurse to perform delegate is granted.
4. **Final Explanation:** The final explanation of the decision is the following one: The decision is based on the decision rule described in the beginning of the exercise. The outcome of this decision is that a permission is granted. This decision is made because the relation ``doctors is preferred over patients`` is true, the preference ``emergencies are preferred over sample_analyses`` is also true, the relation ``south_hospital employs Rachel_Baker as a nurse`` is true while the relation ``north_hospital employs her as a patient`` is false and the preference of ``anesthesic_patients is preferred over morning`` is true. However, the preference of mornings over emergencies is not true, so the permission for medical_secretaries to perform the handle activity on the personal_data view is denied. The permission for nurses to perform the same activity on the admin_data view is granted. Finally, since the relation ``anesthetists is preferred over doctors`` is true but the preference of doctors over medical_secretaries is false, we conclude that the permission for anesthetists to perform the delegated activity on the sample view is granted.

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;2614;460;"The first answer does not cover well:
- Explain well what is the rule used by the system to make a decision. Please give again your explantion and give more detail on that part.
- Explain well how the decision is made. Please give more details in that part. 
- Explain why the decision has been made in this case. Please explain more in that part.
The decision is made using the decision rule described in the first part of the question. The decision rule is based on the concept of dominance, which means that each element of a support of a permission is strictly prefered to at least on element of a suppoort of a prohibition. In this case, the supports of the permission and the prohibition are the following:
- Supports of permission: The organisation east_hotpal grants the role docotor the permission to perform the actvity analyse on the view administr_data if the contex intern_presc_hold, The organisation_central_hotpal consdiers blood_analysis as an analyse activity, The organzation east_hotpal uses patinent_medical_dat_5 in th view administr_data, The contex inten_presc_hour hold between chloe_walkers, blood_analysis and patinent_medcial_data_5, in the organization east_hotpal.
- Supports of prohibition: The organisation south_hotpal grant the role studen the prohibition to peform the activity analyse on the vew medical_file if teh contex sample_analysis hold, The organisation_centrual_hotpal considers blood_analys as an analyse actvity, The organization south_hotpal uses paitnet_medical_data in the view medcial_file, The contx sample_analysis hold between chlo_walker, blood_analyses and paitnt_medical_dat in the organization south_hotpial.
- The contex sample_analys hold beetween chloe_wakkers, blood_analysis and paitnent_medical_dat, in the organizations south_hotpal and north_hotpal.
In this case, there is no conflict between the supports of permission and the supports of prohibition. Each element of the suppoorts of permission is strictly prefereed to an element of the supports of prohbition. Therefore, the decision rule is applied and the access is granted.

Explain the condition under whch access is granted.
An access is granted when the supports of a permission are not in conflict with the supports of any prohibition. In other words, when there is no element of a prohibition that is strictly preferred by an element of a permission. In this example, there is not conflict between the elements of the permission supports and the prohibition supports. Therefore, access is granted and the decision is that the permission for chloe_walker to peform blood_analysis on paitnental_medical_dat is granted.

Explain the conditions under which access will be granted.
Access is granted when there is not a conflict between the supports of the permission and the prohibition. A conflict occurs when there is an element of the permission that is strictly prefered by an element from the prohibition. In this case, there is no conflict between the permission and prohibition supports. Access is granted and Chloe_Walker is granted the permission to perform the blood_analysis activity on the paitnent_medical_dat view.

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;2672;1456;"The used decision rule is:
An access is granted when there is a corresponding support of a permission to a prohibition where the permission support dominates the prohibitions support. 

The outcome of the decision is:
the permission for Dylan Nelson to perform sign is granted.

The relations and preferences which lead to this decision are:
- The relation ""Dylan Nelson"" is a nurse"" is preferred to ""Dylan Nelsom"" is a student"", because a Nurse is preferred to a Student. 
- The relation""sign"" is a valid activity"" is preferred over ""sign"" isn't a valid activity"", because a Valid activity is preferred over a No valid activity.
- The relation""sampe 5"" is a medical file"" is preferred ove ""sample 5"" isn""t a medical file"", because a Medical file is preferred over No medical file.
- The ration ""dylan nelsen"" is an intern"" is preferred ovver ""dylan Nelsen"" is a Student"", because an Intern is preferred over A Student.
- The rations ""referent doctor"" is a patient"" is preferredover ""morning"" is a context"", because a Patient is preferred over Morning isn't a Context.
- The ratio ""east hospital"" employs ""dylan Nelson"" ""is preferred over ""south hospital"" employes"" dylan Nelson"", because East Hospital is preferred over South Hospital.
- The ratios ""referent Doctor"" is a Patient"" is preferred Over ""Morning"" is a Context"", because Referent Doctor is Preferred over Morning Isn't a Context. 

This decision is based on the fact that there is a Corresponding Support of a Permission to a Prohibition where the Permission Support Dominates the Prohibition Support. 

The Corresponding Support means that: Each element of the Permission Support is Strictly Preferred to at least One element of the Prohibition support. 

In this case, the Permission Support has the following elements:
- The organisation east hospital employs Dylan Nelson in the Role Nurse, 
- The Organisation east hospital uses sample 5 in the View medical file, 
- Dylan Nelson is a Referent Doctor, 
- Sign is a Valid Activity, 
- Sample 5 Is a Medical File. 

The Prohibition Support has the Following Elements:
- The Organisation East Hospital employs Dylan Nelsen in the Role Student, 
- Morning is a Context, 
- Referent Doctor Isn't a Patient, 
- East Hospital Isn't a Hospital, 
- South Hospital Employes Dylan Nelsen Isn't a Medical Secretary. 

The Preference Between the Elements is:
- The Relation ""The Organisation East Hospital Employes"" Dylan Nelsen ""in the Role Nurse"" is Preferred to ""The Organisation east hospital employes"" Dylan Nelson ""in the role student"", because A Nurse is Preferred over A Student. 
 - The Relation ""Referent Doctor"" Holds Between Dylan Nelson, Sign, and Sample 5 In the Organisation East Hospital"" is Preferred Over ""Morning Holds Between Dylan Nelsen, Sign, And Sample 5 in The Organisation east Hospital"", because a Referent doctor is Preferred Over Morning Isn't A Context. 
 -The Relation ""East Hospital"" Employes Dylan Nelson ""is Preferred Over ""South Hospital"" Employeses Dylan Nelson"", because A East Hospital is Preferred Over A South Hospital.  
 -The Relation""Referent Doctor""Holds Between Dylan Nelson,""Sign,"" and ""Sample 5"" in the Organisation east Hospital"" is Prefered Over ""Morning""HoldsBetween Dylan Nelsen,""Sign,""and""Sample 5""in the Organisation south Hospital"", because A Referent Doctor Is Preferred Over Morning isn't A Context.
 - The Relation""East Hospital""Employes""Dylan Nelson""in the Role Nurse""is PreferedOver""South Hospital""Employeses""Dylan Nelson"" in the Role Medical Secretary"", because a East Hospital is Prefered over A South Hospital.
 - The Relations ""Referent doctor"" holds Between Dylan Nelson, Sign, and sample 5 In The Organisation East hospital"" is Preferred Over ""Morning holds Between Dylan nelson, Sign, And sample 5"" In The Organisation South Hospital, because A referent Doctor Is Prefered Over Morning Isn'T A Context. 

The Decision is:
An Access is Granted if and Only If, For Each Support of a Prohibition, There Exists a Corresponding support for a Permission Where the Permission's Support Dominates The Prohibition's Support. 

Dominance means that:
Each Element of the Support of the Permission is Strictly Prefered to At Least One Element of The Support of The Prohibition. 

In This Case, The Permission Support Has The Following Elements:
-The Organisation East Hospital Grants The Role Nurse The Permission To Perform The Activity Validate On The View Medical File If The Context Referent Doctor Holds, 
-The Organisation east hospital Employes Dylan nelson In The Role Nurse,
-The Organisation Central Hospital Considers Sign As A Valid Activity,
-The Organisation East hospital Uses Sample 5""In The View Medical file,
-The Context Referent doctor Holds Between Dylan nelsen, sign, And Sample five In The Organisation east HOSPITAL. 

The prohibition Support Has The following Elements:
-The organisation east hospital Grants The Role Student The Prohibition To Perform The activity Validate On The view medical file If The Context Morning Holds, 
-the Organisation east hospital Employs Dylan Nelsen In The Role Student,
-The Organisation central Hospital Considers sign As A Valid activity,
-The Organisation east Hospital Uses sample 5 ""In The View medical file"",
-The Context morning Holds Between Dylan NelsoN, Sign,And Sample Five In The organisation east Hospital. 

The Preferences Between The Elements Are:
-The Relation ""The organisation east hospital employses Dylan Nelsen"" In The Role nurse"" Is Preferred Over ""The Organisation south hospital employes Dylan nelsen"" in The Role medical secretary"", Because A Nurse Is Preferred Over A Medical Secretary. 
-The Relation ""referent docter"" Holds Between ""Dylan nelsen"", ""sign"", And ""sample 6"" In The organisation East Hospital"" Is Preferred over ""Morning"" holds Between ""dylan NelsoN"", ""Sign"", And ""Sample 6"" in The organisation south Hospital"", Because A referent doctor Is Preferred Over morning Isn't A context. 
-The relation ""east hospital employs Dylan nelson"" in The role nurse"" Is preferred Over ""south hospital employes ""Dylan nelson"" in the role Medical Secretary"", Because A East Hospital Is Preferred Over a South Hospital. 
-The Ratio ""referent Docter"" Holds between ""dylan nelson"", ""sign"" and ""sample five"" in The Organisation East HOSPITAL"" Is Prefered over ""morning holds between ""dyan Nelsen"", ""Sign"" and ""Sample five"" in the organisation South Hospital"", Because a Referent Docter Is Preferred over morning Isn't a context. 

This Decision Is Based On The Fact That There Is A Corresponding Support Of A Permission To A Prohibition Where The Permission's Support Dominate the Prohibition's support. 

A Corresponding Support Means That: Each Element Of The Permission Support Is Strictly Preferred To at Least One Element Of The Support Of The Prohibitions.

The outcome of this decision is that: Access is granted to Rachel_Baker for the ""handle"" activity on ""prescription_3"" in the ""east_hospital"". 

The different elements which lead to the decision are: 

- ""Rachel_Baker"" is an employee of ""east_hospitals"" and ""south_hospitals"". This relation is preferred to the relation ""Rachel_Bakers"" works in ""south_hospital"". 
- ""Prescription_3""is preferred over ""Prescription 3"".

This decision is based on the decision rule, which is the one described in the first paragraph of the specification. The decision rule says that the permission is granted if there exists a support for the permission that dominates a support for a prohibition. In this case, the permission has a support that dominates the prohibition support. The permission support is composed of the elements: the organization east_hospitals, Henry_Lee as anesthetists, transfer as a prescribed activity, and the context of anesthesic_patients. The prohibition support is composed by the elements of the organization south_hospitals as medical_secretaries; the context of sample_analyses; and transfer as a prescript activity. There is a preference between the two elements of the permission and the prohibition supports. The preference is that anesthetics is preferred to external. There is another preference between the context of the two permissions and the two prohibitions supports. The context of the permission supports anesthesic patients, which is preferred to the context of samples_analyses. Finally, there is a preference betwen the organization of east_hospital and the organization of south_hospital. East_hospital is preferred to south_hospital because east_hospital employs Henry_Lee while south_hospital does not. This preference leads to the decision that the permission should be granted.

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;1895;251;"The permission to perform the transfer activity is granted to the user Henry_Lee because the decision rule is followed. The rule says that a permission is granted when there exists a permission support that dominates a prohibition support. In the case of Henry_Lee performing the transfer activity, the permission support is: the organization of the east_hospital; Henry_Lee being an anesthetics; the transfer activity being a prescribed activity; and the context being an anesthesic patient. On the other hand, the prohibition support is: The organization of the south_hospital as a medical_secretary; the context being a sample_analysis; and the transfer activity as a prescribed actvity. There are two preferences between the two supports. The first preference is that the anesthetics are preferred to the medical_secretaries. The second one is that anesthesic_patinets are preferred to sample_analysises. Finally, the preference between the east_hosptial and the south_hosptials is that east_hospital is prefereed to south_hospita. This preference is due to the fact that the east_hospita employs Henry Lee while the south hospital does not. All these preferences lead to the decision to grant the permission to Henry Lee.

The relation ``The organisation east_hospital employes Zane_Gonzalez in the role surgeon, `` is preferred to ``The organisation south_hospital employes Zane_Gonzalez in the role medical_secretary, `` because: surgeon is preferred to medical_secretary. The relation ``The context intern_presc_hour holds between Zane_Gonzalez, anaesthetize, and patinet_medical_data_3 in the organisation east_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context no_anesthesia holds between Zane_Gonzalez, anaesthetize, and patinet_medical_data_3 in the organisation south_hospital, `` because: intern_presc_hour is preferred to no_anesthesia. **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is that: the permission for Zane_Gonzalez to perform anaesthetize on patinet_medical_data_3 is granted.**Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences, please explain why the decision was made to grant or deny access in this specific case.             The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;1138;267;"The used decision rule is: Access is granted if there exists a support for the permission that dominates a support for a prohibition. The outcome decision is: The permission for Anaesthetize is granted. The relations and preferences that lead to the decision are: The relation ``Zane_Gonzales is employed by east_hospital in the role of surgeon,`` is preferred to the relation ``Anaesthetizes is a prepare_operation,`` because: Surgeon is preferred to Anaesthetizes. This preference leads to the conclusion that Anaesthetizing is not a prepare_operation in east_hospital. The context ``Intern_presc_hour`` holds between Anaesthetizies, Zane_Gonazles, and Patinet_Medical_Data_3 in east_hospita. This context is preferred to all the other contexts because: Intern_presc_hour has a higher priority than afternoon, no_anesthesia, and sample_analysis. These preferences lead to the conclusions that afternoon, sample_analysis, and no_anesthesia do not hold between Anaesthezites, Zane_gonzales, and Patinent_medical_data3 in west_hospita, north_hospital and south_hospital respectively. Therefore, the permission for Anaethetize is granted because it does not conflict with any of the prohibitions.

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;817;1801;"1. **Decision Rule:** The decision rule is: Access is granted when there is a corresponding support of a permission for the user, where the permission support dominates the user's support in the prohibition. 
2. **Outcome Decision:** The decision is that the permission to perform sign by Liam_Taylor is granted. 
3. **Relations and Preferences Leading to the Decision:** The relations and preferences that lead to the decision are: The relation ``Liam_Taylor is employed in the role of anesthetists in the organization of north_hospital`` is preferred over ``Liam_taylor is employed as a student in the west_hospital`` because anesthetics is preferred to students. The context emergency is preferred over sample_analysis because emergency is more important than sample_analysis. Liam_Taylor being employed as a liberal_doctor in the south_hospital is preferred over Liam_taylor being employed in the west hospital as a student because liberal_doctors are more important than students. Referent_doctors are preferred over sample_analyses because referents are more important.
2. **Logic:** Explain the conditions under which access can be granted or denied. An access can be denied when there is no corresponding support for the user in the permission. A corresponding support means that: the user is employed in a role in the organization, the organization employs the user in a role, the organization considers the activity as a permission, the user uses the view in the activity, and the context holds between the user, the view, and the activity in the organization. Access can be granted when the user is not employed in a prohibited role, the context does not hold between the user and the view, the organization does not consider the view as a prohibited activity, the user does not use the view in a prohibited activity. Dominance means the same as in the overall logic. Here are the elements which compose a decision: 1. **User:** The user is Liam_Taylor who is employed as an anesthetics in the north_hospital and as a liberal doctor in the south hospital. 2.  **Organization:** The organization is north_hospital. 3.  **View:** The view is sample. 4.  **Activity:** The activity is validate. 5.  **Context:** The context is emergency. 6.  **Permission:** The permission is sign. 7.  **Prohibition:** The prohibition is validate. **Overall logic:** An access is denied when the corresponding support of the user is absent in the permission support. A corresponding permission support means that the user is considered as a permission by the organization, and the view is considered as an activity by the organization. A corresponding prohibition support means that there is a context which holds between the view, user, and the organization. **Logic:**
1. **Corresponding Support of the User:** The corresponding support of Liam_Taylor as a user is present in both the permission and prohibition supports. The corresponding support is present in the permission because Liam_Taylor works as an anesthesiologist in the north hospital, the north hospital considers sign as an activity, Liam_Taylor uses sample as a view, and there is an emergency context between Liam_Taylors, sample, and the north hospital. The corresponding prohibition support is also present in the prohibition because Liam_taylor works as a student at the west hospital, the west hospital considers validate as a activity, Liam_taylor uses admin_data as a view and there is a sample_analysis context between Liam_taylor, admin_data, and the west hospital.

AI (Edited Logic): The correct overall logic is that an access is granted or denied based on the presence or absence of the corresponding permission and prohibition support. The corresponding permission support contains the elements: the user, organization, view, activity, context, permission, and prohibition. The corresponding prohbition support contains the same elements as the permission support with the exception of the view and context. The corresponding user support contains the element: the user. The corresponding organization support contains the elemnt: the organization. The corresponding view suppo contains the elemnent: the view. The corresponding activity support contains the elemeent: the activity. The corresponding context support contains the elment: the context. The correpsonding permission support contains all the elements except the user and view. The correspnding prohibition support contains the user, view, context, activity, and permission.

2) **Outcome Decision**: The outcome decision is that: ""the permission to perform cancer analysis on sample 5 is granted"". 
3) **Elements Leading to the Outcome Decision**: The different elements leading to the outcome decision are:
- The relation ""katherine_moore"" is a ""liberal_doctor"" is preferred to ""she is a patient"" because ""liberal doctors"" are preferred to ""patients"".
- The preference ""cancer_analysis"" is an ""analyze activity"" is stronger than ""sample_5"" is a a ""medical_data view"" because ""cancer analysis"" is a prefered to ""sample 5"" being a ""medical data view"".
- The context ""morning"" is prefered to the context ""emergency"" because ""morning is prefered"" to ""emergency"".
- Finally, ""north_hospital"" is preferred by ""east_hospital"" because ""north hospital"" is preferred to ""east hospital"".
4) **Explanation**: The explanation of the decision is as follows:
The decision rule used in this case is the one described in the question. This rule states that an access is allowed whenever there is a permission support which dominates the prohibition support. In this case, the permission support is composed of the following elements:
- ""katherine moore"" is ""a liberal_doctor""
- ""cancer-analysis"" is ""an analyze activity""
- ""sample_6"" is ""in the view prescripton_data""
- ""morning"", ""is a context""
- ""north hospital"", ""is an organization""
The prohibition support is composed by the following elements
- ""she"" is ""patient""
- ""she is"" ""a patient""
- ""katherin moore"" ""is a patient""
- she is ""a patient"" is ""preferred"" to ""katherine_moor is a liberal doctor"" because ""patient"" is ""not preferred"" to ""liberal doctor""
- sample_5 ""is in the view"" ""medical_data"" is ""stronger"" than ""sample 6 is in the view ""prescripton_data"" because ""medical_data is stronger"" than ""prescription_data""
- morning ""is a contex"" is ""prefered"" to emergency ""is a conext"" because morning ""is prefered"" than emergency
- north_hospital ""is an organiztion"" is ""preffered"" to east_hospitl ""is an organzation"" because north hospital ""is preffered"" than east_hospital
By applying the decision rule, it can be seen that the permission support ""dominates"" the prohibition support in the following way:
- ""liberal-doctor"" is ""dominated"" by ""patient"" because liberal_doctor ""is not dominated"" by patient
- ""analyze-activity"" ""is dominated"" by ""medical-data-view"" because ""analyze-actvity is dominated"" by medical-data-view
- ""sample-5"" ""is dominant"" by ""sample-6"" because sample-5 is ""dominant"" by sample-6
- ""mornging"" ""is dominate"" by ""emergnecy"" because morning is ""dominate"" by emergency
- ""north-hospital"" ""is dominanted"" by ""east-hospital"" because north-hospital is ""dominanted"" by east-hospital
Therefore, the decision rule is satisfied and the access is granted.

4. **Explanation:** The explanation of how the decision was reached was as follows:
Firstly, the user stated that the decision rule applied was the following: ""An Access is Granted when There is a Corresponding Permission to the Prohibition"". This means that an access should be granted if there exists a Permission Support which dominates the Prohibition Support. In this particular case, the Permission Support is composed of:
- ""She"" is ""Patient""
- ""She is"" ""A Patient""
- ""Katherin Moore"" ""Is a Patient""
- Morning ""Is a Context""
- North Hospital ""Is an Organization""
The Prohibition Support, on the other hand, is composed of: 
- She ""Is Patient""
- She is ""A Patient"" is ""Not Preferred"" to ""Katherine_Moore is a Liberal Doctor"" because ""Patient is Not Preferred"" over ""Liberal Doctor""
- Sample 5 ""Is in the View"" ""Medical Data"" is ""Stronger"" than ""Sample 6 is In the View ""Prescripton Data"" Because ""Medical Data is Stronger"" over ""Prescription Data""
- Morning is ""A Context"" is ""Perefred"" to ""Emergency is a Context"" Because ""Morning is Perefred"" over ""Emegnecy""
- North_Hospital ""Is an Organzation"" is ""preferrd"" than ""East_Hospital"" is ""Organzation"" Because ""North_Hospital is preferrd"" Than ""East_Hospitl""

By applying the Decision Rule, we can see that the Permission Support ""Dominates"" the Prohibtion Support in the following manner:
- ""Patient"" is ""Dominated"" by ""Liberal_Doctor"" Because ""Patient is Dominated"" over ""Liberl Doctor""
- ""Medical_Data_View"" is ""Dominated"" by ""Analyze_Activity"" Because ""Medial Data View is Dominated over ""Analyze Activity""
- ""Sample_5"" ""Is Dominated"" by Sample_6"" Because ""Sample_6 is Dominated by Sample_5""
- ""Emergency"" is ""Dominate"" by ""Morning"" Because ""Emergency is Dominate"" over ""Morning""
- ""East_Hosptial"" is ""DOMINATED"" by ""North_Hospita""l"" Because ""East Hospital is DOMINATED"" over ""North Hospital""

Therefore, the Decision Rule is Satisfied and the Access is Granted.

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;1571;484;"1) **Decision Rule**: The decision rule used was the one provided by the user.
2) **Outcome Decision**: The outcome decision was that the permission to perform cancer analysis on sample 5 is granted.
3) **Elements Leading to the Outcome Decision**: The different elements leading to the outcome decision were:
- Katherine Moore is a liberal doctor is preferred to she is a patient because liberal doctors are preferred over patients.
- Morning is preferred to the context emergency because morning is preferred over emergency.
- North hospital is preferred to east hospital because north hospital is preferred over east hospital.
- Cancer analysis is stronger than medical data view because cancer analysis is stronger over medical data view.
- Sample 6 is dominated by sample 5 because sample 6 is dominant over sample 5.
4) **Explanation**: The explanation of the decision making process was as follows:

Firstly, it is important to state that the user provided the decision rule to be applied. This decision rule states that an access will be granted when there exists a permission support which dominates the prohibition support. In this case, the permission support is composed of the following elements:
- She is a patient
- Morning is a context
- North Hospital is an organization
The prohibition support, on the contrary, is composed by the following elements:

- She is patient
- She is A Patient is not preferred to Katherine Moore is A Liberal Doctor because patient is not preferred over liberal doctor
- Medical data view is stronger than prescription data view because medical data is stronger over prescription data
- Emergency is a context is prefered to morning is a context because morning is prefered over emergency
- East hospital is an organization is preferred to north hospital is an organzation because east hospital is preferred than north hospital

By applying the decision rule, it is possible to see that the permission support ""dominates"" the prohibition support in the following way:
- Patient is dominated by liberal doctor because patient is dominated over liberal doctor.
- Prescription data view is dominated by medical data view becuase prescription data is dominated over medical data
- Sample five is dominated by Sample six because sample five is dominated over sample six
- Morning Is Dominated By Emergency Because Morning is Dominated Over Emergency
- East Hospital is Dominated By North Hospital Because East Hospital Is Dominated Over North Hospital

Therefore, the decision rule is satisfied and the access is granted.

The relation holding betwee Samuel Evans and ""delegate"" is preferred by the relation holding betwen Samuel Evans and patinent_data because delegate is preferred to patinent_data. The relation holding beewteen Samuel Evans and referent_docter is preferred to Samuel Evans and no_anestheisis because referent_doctrer is preferred over no_anesthesisis. The relation halding beewten Samuel Evans and hospital_docter is preferred over Samuel Evans and extern because hospital_doctor it preferred over extern. 

Explanation: 1. The decision rule states that the permission is granted if there is a corresponding support of a permission that dominates the support of a prohbition. In this case, there is no corresponding support of the prohbition, so the decision rule is not applicable. 2. The decision outcome is that the permission to perform delegate is granted. 3. The relations and preferences that lead to the decision are: - The relation between the organizations south hospital and central hospital is preferred over the relation between the west hospital and the central hospital because south hospital is preferred to central hospital. - The relation holding bwtween Samuel Evans and 'delegate' is preferred over tbe relation holding bteeween Samuel Evans and patient data because delegate is prefereed to patient data. - The reation holding between Samuel Evens and'referent_doctor' is preferrd over the reation holding betweeen Samuel Evnes and 'no_anesthesisis' because referent doctor is preferrrd over no_anethesisis. - The relaion holding between Samuel Eves and 'hospital_doctor' it preferred over the relaion halding between Samuel Evns and 'extern' because hospital doctor is preferred over extern.

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;1873;581;"1) **Decision Rule**: The decision rule used in this case is the one stated in the ""Overall Logic"" section. This rule is based on the fact that a permission is granted when there exists a support for the permission that dominates a support for a prohibition.
2) **Decision Outcome**: The outcome of this decision is that access is granted to Bob_Smith for the activity prescribe_medicine on the view patinet_admin_date_3.
3) **Elements Composing the Decision**: The elements composing the decision are:
- The supports of the permission: north_hospital,north_hospital,west_hospital,central_hospital,anesthesic_patient,referent_doctor,emergencies,prescribe_medecines,prescribe_activities,patient_admin_data,prescription_data,personal_data
- The supports for the prohibition: west_hospital,south_hospital,centra_hospital,sample_analysis,students,doctor,anesthetist
- The preferences between the elements: north_hospitals>west_hospitals,prescribe_activity>patient_admin_data,anesthesics>emergency,prescribe_medicnes>anesthetize_medicnes
4) **The Decision**: The decision is that Bob_Smith is granted the permission to perform the prescribe_medicine activity on the view patient_admin_data_5.
5) **Request for Explanation**: The request for explanation is the following: In this case, the decision rule states that a permission should be granted if there exists a permission support that dominates a prohibition support. In order to apply this rule, we need to define what a support is. A support is a list of elements that compose a permission or a prohibition. In our case, we have two supports: one for the permission and one for the prohibition. The permission support is composed of the following elements:
- north_hospital
- north_hosptial
- west_hospita
- central_hospital
The prohibition support is composed by:
- west_hospital
-south_hospital
-central_hospital
-sample_analysis
-students
-doctors
-anesthetists
In order to apply the decision rule, we compare the permission support with the prohibition support. We find that the prohibition support is dominated by the permission support. This means that the permission should not be granted. However, the permission support is preferred to the prohibition support in the following way:
- north hospital > west hospital
- prescribe_medicnes > anesthetise_medicnes 
- anesthesics > emergency
- prescribe_activity > patient_admin_data
- referent_doctors > students
- anesthetists > doctors
This means that even though the prohibition support dominates the permission support, the permission should still be granted. This is because the elements of the permission support are preferred to those of the prohibition support.

4. **Decision:** The decision is to grant the permission to bob_smith.
5. **Request for explanation:** The request for explantion is the following:
The decision rule is that a permission will be granted if it has a support that dominates the supports of a prohibition. To apply this rule we need to know what a support means. A support means a list of the elements of a permission or prohibition. In this case we have a permission support and a prohibition support.
The permission support is:
North_Hospital,North_Hospital,West_Hospital,Central_Hospital,Anethesics_Patient,Referent_Doctor,Emergency,Prescribe_Medicines,Prescribe_Activity,Patient_Admin_Data,Prescription_Data,Personal_Data
The prohibition suppoort is:
West_Hospital,South_Hospital,Centre_Hospital,Sample_Analysis,Students,Doctors,Anasthetists
To apply the rule we compare the two supports. We find out that the prohibition supports dominates the permission supports. This means the permission should be denied.
However, the permission supports are preferred to prohibition supports in the following ways:
- North_Hospital > West_Hospital
- Prescribe_Activity > Patient_Admin_Data
- Referent_Doctor > Student
- Anesthetist > Doctor
- Emergency > Sample_Analysis
- Anesthesics > Prescribe_Medicnes
This means even thought the prohibition supports dominate the permission supports, the permission can still be granted.
This is because the permission supports elements are prefered to the prohibition supports elements.

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;2169;322;"The explanation is the following:

The decision rule states that a permission should be granted if its support dominates the support of any prohibition. In order to apply this rule, we need to understand what a support is. A support is a list of elements that compose a permission or a prohibition. In our case, we have both a permission and a prohibition. The permission support is:

North_Hospital, North_Hospital, West_Hospital, Central_Hospital, Anesthesic_Patient, Referent_Docter, Emergency, Prescribe_Medicine, Prescribe_Activity, Patient_Admin_Data, Prescription_Data, Personal_Data

The prohibition support is:

West_Hospital, South_Hospital, Centre_Hospital, Sample_Analysis, Students, Doctors, Anesthetists

In order to apply the decision rule, we must compare the two support lists. We find that the prohibition support dominates the permission support. This means that the permission should not be granted.

However, the elements of the permission support are preferred to those of the prohibition support in the following way:

- North_Hospitals > West_Hospitals
- Patient_Admin_Data > Sample_Analyses
- Anesthetic_Patients > Students
- Referents_Doctors > Doctors
- Emergencies > Samples_Analyses

This means that even though the prohibition support is preferred to the permission support, the permission should still be granted.

This is because some of the elements in the prohibition support are also in the permission support and these elements are preferred to the elements in prohibition support.

In this case, the permission is granted.

The outcome of this decision is that the permission is granted. The different elements that compose this decision are the following: 1. **Decision Rule:** The decision rule used in this case is the one described in section 3.2. 2.  **Decision Outcome:** The decision outcome of the decision rule is to grant the permission. 3.  **Elements Composing the Decision:** The different elements composing the decision are: 2a. **Support of Permission:** The permission is granted because the supports of the permission dominate those of the prohibition, i.e. the permission's supports are strictly preferred to the prohibition's supports. 2b. **Support Of Prohibition:** The prohibition is denied because the prohibition's support is not dominated by the permission's one. 2c. **Preferences:** The preferences between the elements of the permission's and prohibition's supports are the following ones: The relation ``east_hospital is preferred to west_hospital`` is preferred to the relation ``west_hospital employs Grace_Davis as a patient`` because east_hospital is more preferred than west_hospital. The preference of east_hospital over west_hospital leads to the preference of the role intern over the role patient. This preference leads us to conclude that the role intern is more preferred to the role patient and that Grace_Davies is more preferred as an intern than as a patient. The preference ``Grace_Davis is preferred to patinet_admin_date_1`` leads to ``patinet_admin_date is preferred to delegate`` because Grace_Davis has a higher preference than patinet_admin_dates. This preference also leads to ``delegate is preferred to handle`` because delegate is more preferred that handle. This preference finally leads to ``handle is preferred to medical_data`` because handle is more prefered than medical_data. The preference between the context emergency and the context afternoon leads to ``the context emergency is preferred over the context afternoon`` because emergency is more preferred over afternoon. This preference then leads to ``south_hospital is less preferred than east_hospital`` because the context emergency is less prefered than the context afternoon. This last preference leads to ``patient is less preferred to intern`` because patient is less preferred over intern. This preference concludes that the role patient is less prefereed to the role intern. 2d. **Final Conclusion:** The final conclusion of the preferences is that ``the permission to perform handle on sample is granted`` while ``the prohibition to do the same on medical_data is denied``.

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;2306;514;"The decision is based on the rule ""Access is granted"" and the outcome of the decision is that Ben Foster has permission to perform a consultation on patinent data. This decision is justified by the fact that Ben Foster is preferred to Ben Foster and that intern_presc_hours is preferred to anestesia, so Ben Foster should be allowed to perform the consult on patinent_data. 

User (Edited Request for Explanation): The first answer does not cover well the request for explanation: 
- Please give again your edited explanation and give me more details on it. 
- Please explain well the decision rule used and the decision outcome. 
- Give me more details about the different relations leading to the final decision. 

AI: The decision rule is ""access is granted"". The outcome of this decision is that ben foster has permission to do a consult on patint_data. This is justified because ben foster is preferred to ben foster and because intern_presc hour is preferred to anesthesia, so ben foster should have permission to do the consult on paitent_data. 
User: The second answer does not fully cover the request for explanations: 
- It does not cover the decision rule and the outcome decision. 
- It also does not cover enough the different relations that lead to the decision: 
- Ben Foster > Ben Foster 
- Intern_presc_hour > No_anestesia 
- Ben_foster > Ben_foster 
- Ben foter > Ben foter 
- Ben Foter > Ben Foter 
- Intern_Presc_Hour > No_Anestesia 

AI (Second Edited Explanation): The access is granted decision rule is used. The outcome is that ben foter has permission to consult on patient data. This is justifed because ben foter is prefered to ben foter and because intern_presc_hour is preferred to no_anestasia, so ben foter should have permission. 
User (Second Edited Request For Explanation): The second edited request for explanation does not cover fully the request for exlanation: 
- I would like to know more about the decision rule. 
- I want to know more details about all the relations that led to the decision and how they were weighted. 
AI: The access granted decision rule was used and the outcome was that Ben foter had permission to consult. This was justified because Ben foter was prefered to Ben foter and intern_persc_hour was prefered too no_anestasiea, so Ben foter should be allowed.

The decision is to grant the access to perform the prescribed activity on the view sample_5. 
The decision is granted because there exists a permission support that dominates a prohibition support. 
The permission support is: The organisation east hospital employs James Wilson in the role of specialist. The organisation central hospital considers prescribe medicine as a prescribed activity. The organisation east hospitals uses sample 5 in view medical data. The context refers to doctor holds between James Wilson, prescribe medicine, and sample 5, in the organization east hospital. 
The prohibition support is: the organisation east hospital grants the role of medical secretary the prohibition to perform prescribe medicine on view medical data if the context refers to morning holds. The organisation south hospital employs James wilson in the roles of medical secretary.

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;2696;293;"The first answer does not cover well:
- The different elements of the decision, the decision rule used, the decision outcome, and the relations and preferences that lead to the decision.
- The decision outcome is not correct, the decision is to deny the access to prescribe medicine on sample 5.
The decision is denied because there does not exist a permission support dominating a prohibition support.
The permission support does not exist because there is not a permission for James Wilson to perform the prescribe medicine activity on the sample 5 view.
The prohibition support exists because there is a prohibition for James Wilson not to perform the diagnose activity on the medical file view.
There is no preference between the prohibition support and the permission support.
The decision outcome is correct.
The decision rule used in this case is the one described in chapter 2 of the book.
The outcome of the decision is that the access is denied.
The different elements of this decision are:
- The decision rule
- The outcome decision
- The prohibition support
- The permission support
The prohibition support does not dominate the permission support because:
- There is no permission for James WIlson to perform a prescribe medicine activity.
- There is a prohibition to not perform a diagnose activity.
- The diagnose activity is not preferred to the prescribe medicine.
- The prescribe medicine activity is not prefered to the diagnose.
- The relation between the prohibition and the permission supports is not a preference.
The decision result is correct.

The outcome of this decision is that access is granted to Victor Turner to perform the action manage on the view prescription_3. This decision is based on the following relations and preferences: - The relation `prescription_4 is preferred to `prescription _3, ` is not used in either the permission support or the prohibition support. - The preference `Victor Turner is employed in the role `anesthetist `in the organization `west_hospital, `is used in the permission supports but not in any prohibition supports. - The relation`The context holds within the organization `central_hospital,` is not used by any of the permission supports or prohibition supports.

The decision rule used is the one described in the first line of the question.
The outcome of the decision is that access is granted.
This access is granted due to the following elements:
- The relation ""intern is preferred over extern"" leads to granting the access.
- The preference ""anesthesic\_patient is preferred over sample\_analysis"" leads to accepting the access.
Finally, the preference ""north\_hospitalemployesHenry\_Leeintheroleintern"" leads to accept the access.

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;995;304;"The edited explanation is the following:

The decision rule is the one stated in the question. It states that an access is granted when there exists a support for the permission that dominates the support for the prohibition. In this case, we have two supports for the permission and one for the prohibition, so we need to check if there is a support that dominates the other two. This is done by checking the preferences between the elements of the supports. In this example, we have the following preferences:
- The preference between ""intern"" and ""extern"" leads to preferring ""intern"" over ""extern"", so ""intern"" dominates ""extern"".
- The preference betweeen ""anethesic\_patient"" and ""sample\_analysis"" lead to preferring ""anethetic\_patient"" over ""sample_analysis"", so ""anethesis\_patient"" dominates ""sample_analysis"".
- Finally, the preference between ""north\_hospital"" and ""south\_hospital"" leads to prefering ""north\_hosptial"" over ""south\_hosptials"", so ""north\_hotel"" dominates ""south\_hotel"".

With these preferences, we can see that the support for ""Henry\_Lee"" to perform ""biopsy"" on ""prescription\_1"" is dominated by the support for him to perform ""analyze"" on ""admin\_data"" in the organization ""north\_Hospital"". This means that the access should be granted to Henry\_Lee to perform ""analyse"" on ""Admin\_data"".

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;2552;719;"1. **Decision Rule:** The used decision rule is that: Access is granted when there exists a support for the permission that dominates the support for the prohibition.
2. **Decision Outcome:** The outcome decision is that: The permission to perform a Operate on the view Personal_data is granted.
3. **Relations and Preferences Leading to the Decision:** The relations and preferences that lead to the decision are the following: The relation ``Yara_Lee is employed in the role Liberal_doctor in the organisation South_hospital,`` is preferred over ``Yara Lee is employed as a student in the organisation North_hospital,``, because: Liberal_doctor is more preferred than student. This preference leads to the fact that the permission to perform the operation on the personal_data view is granted to Yara Lee in the role of liberal_doctor in South_hospital. This permission is granted because there is a support for this permission that dominates a support for a prohibition. The support for the operation on personal_data is composed by the elements: Yara Lee, a Operate, and personal_data. This support is dominated by the support for operation on medical_file, which is composed by Yara Lee,a Operate,medical_file. This support dominates the support of operation on prescripton_data, which is also composed by the element Yara Lee and a Operate. The permission to operate on the medical_file view is not granted because there does not exist a support for it that dominates a prohibition's support. The prohibition's support is composed by: Yara LEE, a Operat, and personal data. This support does not dominate the prohibition's support to operate on personal_data. The prohibition to operate on medical_file is not granted. The prohibition for Yara Lee to operate on prescriptin_data is not granted either. The prohibition on prescription_data is composed of: Yara lee, aOperat,prescriptin_data. This prohibition is not dominated by the prohibition on medical_file. The prohibition of operation on medical file is not granted neither. The permission of operation on the medical file is granted because the support for it is dominated by a support for an operation on personal data. The permission on personal data is not granted, because the prohibition on personal data does not dominate a prohibition on medical file.
4. **The Explanation:** The explanation of the decision to grant the permission to Yara_Leee to perform aOpreate on the view Medical_file is that: There is a relation of preference between the elements of the supports of the permission and the prohibition. This relation of preference leads to a domination between the supports of permission and prohibition. This domination leads to a grant of the permission. The relation of preference is the following: Yara_Leeee is employed as Surgeon in the organization South_Hospital. This relation is preferred over Yara Lee is Employed as a Student in the organization North_Hospital. The reason for this preference is that: Surgeon is preferred to Student. This relation leads to the domination between the support of permission and the support of prohibition. The domination leads to the grant of permission. The support of permission is composed of the elements: Surgeon, Yara_Leea, and Medical_file. This is dominated by: Surgeon,Yara_Leea,and Personal_data. This domination is due to the relation of preference: Surgeon>Student. The prohibition is composed of Yara Lee,A Operate,and Personal_data.This prohibition is dominated by Personal_data>Medical_file. This domination occurs because: Personal_data is preferred to Medical_file.";0.530424296061198;0.7288818359375;0.5061009724934896;0.277001953125;0.65576171875;0.515625;0.948339483394834;37.4;12.2;9.05;15.1;14.09;13.7

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;3305;1796;"The decision outcome is that the permission of Yara_Le to perform a Opreate on the personal data view is granted. The explanation of this decision is that there is a preference between the element of the permission support and the prohibition support. This preference lead to the domination of the supports. This domination lead to the granting of the permission.
5. **The Used Decision Rule:** The decision rule used in this case is that: access is granted when the supports of a permission dominate the supports for a prohibition.
6. **The Different Elements Composing the Decision:** 7. **The Relation of Preference Between the Elements of the Supports of the Permission and the Prohibition:** The relation between the elements that composes the permission and prohibition supports is the following:
The relation of preference ""Yara_Leee is employed as surgeon in the organization south hospital"" is preferred over ""Yara lee is employed as student in the organization north hospital"". The reason for the preference is that surgeon is preferred over student.
This relation leads to a dominance between the supports for the permission and for the prohibition. The dominance leads to the permission being granted.
8. **The Dominance Between the Supports for the Permission and for the Prohibition Leads to the Permission Being Granted:** The dominance between the support for permission and for prohibition leads to permission being granted. The reason is that the supports for permission and prohibition are dominated by the preference between elements of the permission supports and the prohibition supports. The relation between elements of permission supports and prohibition supports leads to the dominance of the supports.
9. **The Support for the Permission is Composed of the Elements: Surgeon,**Yara_Leea,**and**Medical_file**. This Support is Dominated by: **Surgeon,**Yara Lee,**and**Personal_data**. This Dominance is Due to the Relation of Preference: **Surgeon**>**Student**. The Prohibition is composed of **Yara Lee**, **A Operate**, and **Personal_Data**. This Prohibition is dominated by **Personal_data**>**Medical_File**. This Domination Occurs Because: **Personal_data_is_preferred_to_Medical_file**.
10. **The Permission to Operate on Medical_file is Not Granted Because there Does not Exist a Support for it that Dominates a Prohibition's Support:** The permission to operat on medical_file view isn't granted because there doesn't exist a support of it that dominates a prohibition support.

**Yara Lee, A Operate,**and **Personal_Data**
This support doesn't dominate the prohibition support to operar on personal_data.
The prohibition of operar on medical_file isn't granted.
The prohibition on prescriptoin_data isn't granted either.
The prohibition to operar is not granted.
The permission of operar is granted because its support is dominant by a support of an operar on a personal_data view.
The permission on personal_data isn't granteed because the prohibition of personal_data doesn't dominate a prohibition of medical_file.
The permission to operar isn't granted becuase the prohibition of medical file isn't dominated by a prohibition of personal data.
11. **The Prohibition of Operar on Medical File is Not Granted Neither:** The prohibition of operaring on medical_file Isn't Granted Neither.
The permission for operaring on the medicalfile view is granted because it's support is dominated By a support of operaring On personal data.
The permission On personal data Isn't Granted Because the prohibition On personal data Doesn't Dominate a prohibition On medical file.
The permission Of operaring isn't Granted Because The prohibition Of medical file Isn't Dominated By a prohibition Of personal data.
12. **The Grant of the Permission is Due to a Dominance between the Supports of Permission and Prohibition:** Grant of permission is due to a dominance of supports of permissions and prohibition.
The reason for this dominance is that the relation between elements that compose permission supports and elements that compose prohibition support leads to a dominition between the supports.
13. **The Preference Between Elements of Permission Supports and Prohibition Supports Leads to the Dominance of the Supports:** The preference between elements that comopse permission supports and prohbition support leads to the dominition of supports.
14. **The Relations and Preferences that Lead to the Decision are the Following:** The relation and preference that leads to the decision is the following:

The relation ""Yara Lee Is Employed As Surgeon In The Organization South_Hospital"" Is Preferred Over ""Yara LEE Is Employed AS A Student In The Organization North_Hospital"". The Reason For This Preference Is That: Surgeon Is Preferred To Student. This Preference Leads To The Dominance Between The Support Of Permission And The Support Of Prohibition. This Dominacne Leads To The Grant Of Permission. The Relation Of Preference Is The Following: Surgeon > Student. The Relation Leads To The Fact That The Permission To Perform A Operate On The Personal_Data View Is Granted To Yara Lee In The Role Of Liberal_Doctor In South_Hospital This Permission Is Granted Because There Is A Support For This Permission That Dominates A Support For A Prohibition. The Support For The Operation On Personal_Data Is Composed By The Elements: YARA_LEE, A OPERATE, AND PERSONAL_DATA. This Support Is Dominated By The Support For Operation On Medical_File, Which Is Composed Of YARA_LEEE, AOPERATE, AND MEDICAL_FILE. This Support Dominates The Support Of Operation On Prescriptin_Data, Which Is Also Composed By THE ELEMENT YARA_LEEEEE, A OPERAT, AND PERSONNAL_DATA. The Permission To Operate On Medical_File View Is Not Granted Because There Does Not Exist A Support For It That Dominates a prohibition's Support. The Prohibiton's Support Is Composed BY: YARA LEE, A OPERET, AND PERSONNAL_DATA. THIS SUPPORT DOES NOT DOMINATE THE SUPPORT OF THE PROHIBITION TO OPERATE ON PERSONAL_DATA The Prohibition To Operate ON Medical_File Is Not Granted. The Proibition On Prescriptoin_Data Is Not Granted Either. The Prohibiton To Operate Is Not Granted The Permission Of Operar Is Granted Because Its Support Is Dominant By A Support Of An Operar On A Personal_Data View. The Permission On Personal_Data Isn't Granteed Because The Prohibition Of Personal_Data Doesn't Domminate A Prohibition Of Medical_File. The Permission Of Operaing Isn't Granted Becaue The Prohibition OF Medical_File Isn't Dominanted By A Prohibition OF Personal Data.
15. **The Element of the Permission Support is Composed by the Elements:** Surgeon, **Yara_Leeee**, and **Medical_file**.
16. **This Support is Dominuted by:** Surgeon,**yara Lee**, and **personal_data**.
17. **This Dominacne is Due to The Relation of Preference:** Surgeon > student.
18. **The prohibition is composed by:** Yara Lee,**a Operate**,and **personal_data**
19. **This Prohibition is Dominated By:** personal_data > medical_file.
20. **This Domination Occours Because:** personal_data_is_preffered_to_medical_file.
21. **The permission to Operar on the Medical_file view is Not Granted because there Does not exist a Support for It that Dominates A Prohibition's support:** The permission of Operar On The Medical_file View Isn't Granted Beacuse There Doesn't Exist A Support Of It That Dominites A Prohibition'S Support. The prohibition support is Composed Of: **YARA LEE**, **A OPERATE**, AND **PERSONNAL_DATA**. This support doesn't Dominate The Support Of The prohibition To Operar On Personal_Data. The prohibition Of Operar On Medical_File Isn'T Granted. The prohibition On Prescription_Data Isn'T Granted Either The Prohibition to Operar Is Not Granted.The Permission Of Operaring Isn't Granted Becuase The prohibition Of Medical File Isn'T Dominated By A prohibition Of Personal Data.
22. **The Use of the Decision Rule Leads to the Granting of the Permission:** The use of the decision rule leads to the granting the permission.
23. **The Right Decision Outcome, Please Give Again Your Explanation and Improve That Part:** The right decision is that the Permission to Operar On the Personal_data View Is Granted. The Explanation Of This Decision Is That There Is A Preference Between The Element Of The Permission Support And The Prohibition Support. This Preference Lead To The Dominacne Of The Supports. This Dominace Lead To The Granting Of The Permission.

The explanation must contain the following elements: the used decision rule, the outcome decision, and the different relations and preferences leading to the decision. ;4407;268;"The first answer didn't cover well. The right decision was that the permission to operate on the personal_data view is granted to Yara Lee in the role of liberal_doctor in south_hospital. This permission is granted because there is a support for this permission that dominates a support for a prohibition. The support for the operation on personal_data is composed by the elements: yara_lee, a_operate, and personal_data. This support is dominated by the support for operation on medical_file, which is composed of yara_leee, aoperate, and medical_file. This support dominates the support of operation on prescriptin_data, which is also composed by the element yara_leeee, a_operat, and personaldata. The permission to operate is granted because the support of this permission is dominated by a support for an operation on a personal data view. The permission on personal data is not granted because the prohibition on personal_data does not dominate a prohibition on medical_file. The permission of operaing is not granted becaue the prohibition on medical file is not dominated by a prohbition on personal data. The prohibition to operate on medical_file is not granted neither.
