### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]

### Output:";2214;464;"

### Structured Explanation

**Decision Rule:**
Access is granted under the condition that for every supporting role (prohibition) of a prohibited activity, there corresponds a supporting role in a permissible action where the permissible action's role strictly dominates the prohibited activity's role.

**Outcome:**
The access has been granted because all supporting roles of prohibitions have been dominated by corresponding roles in permissible actions.

**Relations andPreferences:**
- **Permissible Roles (Supports for Permissions):**
  - **Institute3:** 'Dylan_Nelson' in 'Researcher' (preferred over 'Institute1 Researcher') due to 'reasearcher' being preferred to 'institute1 researcher'.
  - Institute3 also prefers 'D Dylan' over 'University1 Dylan' due to context preferences.
  - University2 prefers Dylan over University1 Dylan due to their respective contexts.
  
  **Permitted Role Domination:**
  The permission support for Dylan's role in 'move' (from Institute3) dominates the prohibiting role 'context audit holds' from Institute3.

- **Prohibited Roles (Permissions for Prohibitions):**  
  Institute1 and University1 prohibit 'post_doc' and ' PhD_student' respectively, with their prohibitions dominated by 'context collaboration holds'.

- **Context Preferences:**  
  Context audits hold are preferred over collaboration holds. audits are preferred to collaborations, as audits are more specific.

**Domination Conditions:**
For each prohibiting role, the corresponding permissible role must strictly dominate it. This includes:
- Institute3's context audit holding dominates Institute1's context collaboration.
- University2's context audits dominate University1's collaborations.

**Final Conclusion:**
All conditions for dominance are met, granting access to Dylan's move.

---

**Answer:**
1.Decision Rule:
Access is denied if for any prohibiting support, no corresponding permissible support strictly dominates it.

2.Outcome:
The access is denied because some prohibitions were not dominated by their corresponding permissible roles.

3.Relations and Preferences:
Institution3's preference for Dylan over Institute1 Dylan. Institute3 prefers context audits over context collaborations. Institute1 prefers context collaborations over Institute3 contexts. Institute2's preferences for Dylan and post_doc over respective prohibitions.

An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision:

### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

```

To get started, I need to understand the problem and the input. The problem is about granting access based on certain conditions involving permissions and prohibitions. The input provides the overall logic, the different supports of permissions, the supports of prohibitions, and the preferences between elements. My task is to explain how the decision was made, using the provided structured format.

Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the input to understand what each part contains. The overall logic gives the condition for access being granted. It says that access is given if for each_support of a Prohibition, there's a corresponding Support of a Permission where the Permission's Support dominates the Prohibitions's Support. Domination here means each element in the Support of the Permission must be strictly preferred over the corresponding in the Prohibited Support.

Next, the Supports of Permission are listed. Each support is a list of elements. For example, Support 1 for the Permission includes elements like ""organize Institute3 grant the role..."" and so on. Similarly, for other supports.

The Supports of Prohibited are also given, each with their own elements.

Then, there are preferences between the elements. These preferences tell us which element is preferred over another. For instance, ""The relation 'The organisation... employes ...' is preferred"" etc. Each preference is a relation between two elements, indicating which one is preferred.

So, the decision process involves checking for each Prohibition Support whether there exists, for its elements, a corresponding Permission Support where each element is strictly dominated. The dominance is determined by the preferences.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. For each Support in Prohibited:
   a. Check if the elements in this support can be dominated by some Support in the corresponding Permission.
   b. The domination must be strict, meaning each element must strictly dominate the corresponding one in the prohibited support.

2. If for all Prohibited supports, such a dominating Permission Support exists, then access is allowed.

3. If any Prohibited support doesn't have such a dominated Permission Support, then the access is denied.

4. The decision is based on the dominance relations and the given preferences.

Now, let me apply this to the given example.

Looking at the Input:

Overall Logic:
- For each Prohib, check if for its support, exists a Permission support where its support dominates.
- Domination is strict: each perm support element > prohibited support element.

Supports:
- Each support list (1, 2, 3, etc.) for Permission and Prohibition.

Prohibitions:
- Their supports are given.

Preferences:
- A list of relations, each indicating a preference between elements.

From the preferences, it's clear that certain elements are preferred over others.

For example:
- The relation ""context audit holds"" is preferred above ""context collaboration holds"" because audit is better than collaboration.
- Similarly, other relations like ""wp_leader"" preferred over "" staff_member"" because wp_leader > staff_member.

I need to map these preferences to see how they influence the dominance checks.

Let's take the example given in the problem:

The decision outcome is that permission for ""Rachel_Baker"" to perform ""move"" on ""report6"" is granted due to the dominance condition.

Looking back at the supports:

For example, support 1 in Prohibition (from the input) is ""The organization... grant... Prohibition..."" So the support for Prohibition 1 is the elements listed, which are things like ""org_institute3 grant..."" etc.

Similarly, for Support of Permission, for the role "" wp_leader"" is present in one support and in another.

Wait, perhaps it's better to list each support for both and see their elements.

But given the complexity, perhaps I should think in terms of the decision rules.

In the problem's example, the logic is that for each prohibited support, there must be a corresponding permission support where each of its elements is strictly more preferred than the corresponding prohibited support's elements.

So for example, if a prohibited support has elements A, B, C, then for each of these, we need to find a permission support that strictly dominates them.

If for all prohibited supports, this condition is met, then it's allowed.

So to model this, we can represent each support as a set of elements, and for each such set, check whether each element can be strictly dominated by an element from a corresponding set in the Permission support.

But how to formalize this?

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the decision as follows:

For each support in Prohibit:
   Let S_p be the support.
   For each element e in S_p, find a support S_f in Permission such that for all elements e' in S_f, e' > e.
   If such an S_f exists for all e, then proceed; else, deny.

Therefore, the key is to check for each e in each S_p whether there is a corresponding S_f where e is dominated.

Given that, now let's try to apply this logic to the problem.

The problem's overall logic is:

Access is granted iff for each Support of Prohib (S_p), there exists S_f (Support of Permission) where S_f's support strictly dominates S_p's support.

Domination is defined as: for all i, S_f_element_i > S_p_element_i.

Dominance is a strict partial order, so it's possible for some S_p to have no S_f that dominates it.

But if for all S_p in S_prohibit, there is some S_f such that S_f_dominates(S_p), then access granted.

Otherwise, access denied.

So in the example:

The Prohibit support for Rachel-Baker's Prohib is the support where the role is ""move"".

Looking at S_p (Prohibition support) for move: it's the elements {org_institue3 grant, ... , report6}.

Wait no, the S_p for the Prohibit for move is the specific support. Wait, perhaps the example's S_p is for the specific role, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the example is structured as:

Each support for the prohibitions (e.g., for ""move"") is a group of elements involved in the prohibition.

Similarly for the permissions.

So perhaps for the example, S_p consists of the role assignments, and S_f consists of permissions.

In that case, for S_p = {move}, S_f needs to have elements that strictly dominate move.

So if S_f has, say, ""Permission to perform modify"" as a support, and move is a part of that support, then dominance is achieved.

But I think I'm overcomplicating.

The key is that the decision is made by checking whether for every element in each Prohibit Support, whether a corresponding element in a Permission Support strictly dominates it, according to the preference (i.e., the relation) between the two.

So let's model this.

For each Probit Support S_p:

   For every element e ∈ S_p:
       Find a permutation of the S_f Support (which is the Permission Support) such that each e' ∈ S_f strictly dominates e.

   If for any e, such an e' does not exist, then S_p cannot be dominated, so access is not granted.

Thus, the problem reduces to checking for all such S_p and e's whether the dominance is possible.

If any S_p fails this check, then overall access is disallowed.

So now, in the given input, we have multiple S_p supports for different prohibitions.

We need to see if for every S_p support in the S_prohibits, whether for each element, a S_f support exists which strictly dominates that element.

To do this, I can model each S_f and S_p as sets, and check for dominance.

But since the input is quite detailed, perhaps a better approach is to simulate the decision.

So first, list all the Probit Supports and their elements:

From the input:

S_probit 1: {support1 of Probit}
support1: The organization ... grant ... Probit to perform on ... report6.

So S_probit1's elements are [ ... , move, report6 ]

Similarly, support2 for Probit is similar.

But perhaps the exact elements are not important, but the relations are.

The S_f for the permission support would be, for example:

S_f1: support1 for Permission (which includes roles like ""secondee"", ""staff_member"", ""edit"", ""report1"", etc.)

S_f2: same for support2.

S_f3: same as well.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports:

        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1599;864;"

To determine whether the access should be granted, we need to analyze the given logic and input. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Overall Logic
The overall logic for granting access is based on the following condition:
- For each **support** of a **prohibition**, there must exist a **corresponding support** for a **permission** where the **permission's support** dominates the **prohibited support**.
- Dominance is defined as each element in the permission support being **strictly preferred** to or matches at least **one element** in the prohibited support.
- Additionally, there are preferences between different elements (e.g., roles, contexts, etc.) that influence the decision.

### Input Data:
1. Overall Logic:
   - **For access to be granted:**
     - If, for **each support** of **a prohibition**, there exists **a corresponding support** in **a permission** where:
       - The permission support's elements **dominate** the prohibitions' elements.
       - Domination is determined by strict preference or equality.
     - Additionally, preferences between elements (roles, contexts) influence the outcome.

2. Supports of Permission (Smp):
   - Support 1:
     - Organisation University2: Grabs the role ""team_leader"" for ""Permission to perform activity validate"" under the view ""WP5"" when the context ""audit holds"" is active.
     <br>
     - Organisation Institute1: Similarly, ""role ""coordinator"""" for ""Perform validation"" under ""WP1"" with context ""secondment holds"" active.
   - Note: All other supports are not relevant for this analysis.

3. Sups of Prohibitions (Sph):
4. Preferences Between Elements (PrE):
   a. ""University2"" ""employs"" ""Eva_Clark"" in ""role team_leader"" is preferred over ""Institute1"" similar role.
   b. ""Context audit"" holds over ""context default.""
   c. ""Coordinators"" are preferred to ""associate_professor.""
   d. ""Secondment"" holds higher priority than ""default.""

### Analysis:
- **Step 1:** We need to check if for every ""support"" of a ""prohibition,"" there's a corresponding ""permission"" support where the ""permission support"" dominates the ""probidden support.""
- **Smp for Prohibition 1 (P1):** The ""context audit holds"" condition is met.
- **PrE (Domination):** ""Team_leader"" (from P1) is dominated by ""coordinators,"" meaning the permission (P2) supports ""sign"" (which is part of P1's support) in a way that satisfies dominance.

### Conclusion:
The access is **granted** because all required conditions are satisfied, particularly the dominance of permission support over prohibitions.

### Final Answer:
**Decision Rule:**
Access is granted based on dominance conditions where each permission support element strictly dominates a prohibitions support element.

**Outcome:**
The access decision is granted due to the dominance conditions satisfied across all relevant permission and prohibitions supports.

**Relation and Preferences:**
- **Domination Condition:** For each support, a corresponding permission support exists where each element is strictly dominated.
  - Example: ""Sign"" (part of the P1 support) is strictly dominant in the P2 (permission) support, meeting the dominance condition.

**Final Answer:**
1. The decision rule is dominance where permission supports strictly dominate prohibitions.
2. The outcome is access granted because all conditions are met.
3. The relations include context audit holding over default, preference of coordinators over associate professors, and team leadership over coordinators.
4. The conclusions are based on these relations, leading to the final decision.

**Answer:**
**1.** The decision is made based on strict dominance conditions.
**2.** Access was granted.
**3.** Relations: Context audit holds over default. Preferences: Coordinators > associate professors. Team leadership > coordinators. Domination: Sign strictly dominates P1.
**4.** Conclusions: All conditions met, so access granted.

        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity.

### Output:";2260;338;"

To determine whether access to the system is granted, we analyze the given logic and input. Here's the structured explanation:

### Decision Rule
Access is granted based on the condition that for each ""support"" of a ""prohibition,"" there must exist a ""corresponding"" ""permission"" where the ""permission's support"" strictly dominates the ""prohibited support."" Additionally, preferences between elements are considered to influence the outcome.

### Outcome
The access is **granted** because all conditions are satisfied, and the permission to perform ""create"" on ""dataset4"" meets the dominance criteria relative to the prohibitions.

### Relations andPreferences
- **Domination Conditions:**
  - **Permission Support Dominates Prohibition Support:**
    - For each element in the permission support, there is a corresponding element that strictly dominates it in the prohibited support.
    - Example: The permission ""to perform create"" is strictly dominated by the prohibited ""activity modify"" in all relevant contexts.
- **Element Dominance Preferences:**
   - **Role Dominance:**
     - Elements like ""wp_leader"" are preferred over ""secondee"" and ""associate_professor"" due to preferences.
     - ""Create"" is preferred over others, as it aligns with the required dominance in specific contexts.
   - Context Dominance:
     - Context preferences like ""audit"" over ""collaboration"" influence whether prohibitions can be met.
- All element and context preferences are considered, ensuring that the dominance conditions are met for access.

### Conclusion
By evaluating the dominance of permission supports over prohibitions and considering the preferences, we conclude that access is successfully granted.";0.6840922037760417;0.5762532552083334;0.389495849609375;0.724609375;0.96728515625;0.2371826171875;0.9741379310344828;9.18;16.9;15.25;17.7;18.33;19.6

### Output:";1408;339;"

### Structured Output:

**1. Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted under the condition that for every restriction (support) of a prohibitive role, there is a corresponding restriction of a permissible role where the permissible role's restriction strictly dominates the prohibitive restriction.

**2. Outcome:**  
The decision was made to grant access because all restrictions (supports ) of prohibitive roles were strictly dominated by the corresponding restrictions of permissible roles.

**3. Relations and Preferences:**  
- **Domination Between Permissible and Prohibitive Restrictions:**  
  For each prohibitive support, there was a corresponding permissible support where each element in the permissible support was strictly preferred over the corresponding prohibitive element.  
  - Example: The role assigned by the University3 (Amelia_King) in the full-professor role was preferred to the University2 role in the associate-professor. This preference was based on the dominance relation, where each full_prof professor was more preferred than the associate_prof professor.  

**4. Other Influences:**  
No additional preferences or considerations were found to influence the decision beyond the specified relations.

### Explanation:

The decision process for granting access is based on evaluating the dominance relations between the supports of prohibitions and permissible roles. For each support (restriction) of the prohibitions, there must exist a permissible support that strictly dominates it. This dominance is determined by the given preference relations, where certain roles or elements are preferred over others.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

Now, let's move on to the next part of the problem.

---

Now, for the given example input, the output is as follows:

The output should be in the form of a structured response, similar to the example provided. I need to carefully analyze the example to understand the logic and then apply it to the given input.

Let me try to break down the example input step by step.

The example input is structured as:

1. Overall Logic: This explains the condition for access being granted. It mentions that access is given if for each prohibition support, there's a corresponding permission support where the permutation of support elements dominates the prohibitions.

2. Supports of Permission: This lists the elements (supports) for the permissions.

3. Similarly, the supports of prohibitions are listed.

4. Preferences between the elements are given.

Then, the example output explains the decision rules, the outcome, and the relations with preferences.

In the given problem, the input is more detailed, but the structure is similar.

I need to parse the input correctly, extract the necessary information, and then follow the structured output format.

So, first, I'll go through the input and identify the different sections.

1. The overall logic is given, explaining the condition. So, I can extract the logic rule from here. For example, in the example, it's about permutation dominance.

But in the problem statement, the overall logic seems to be the same as the example's, so I can refer to that.

Next, supports of permissions and prohibitions. These are lists of elements (support roles) for each.

Then comes the preferences between elements, which define which preferences are stronger than others.

Once I have all the information, the next step is to structure it according to the problem's instructions.

The output needs to be in a structured format with sections 1 to 5, each containing specific information.

I think the key steps are:

- Parse the input into the required components: overall logic, permissions supports, prohibitions supports, preferences.

- Then, using these components, construct the explanation as per the example.

Now, thinking about how to structure the code for this.

But since I'm just writing the thought process, perhaps I can outline the steps.

Let's think of the code structure.

First, read the input string and split it into sections.

The input is divided into multiple lines, each line representing a section.

The first line is the Overall Logic, which gives the condition.

The next lines are the Supports of Permissions and Prohibitions.

Then follows the Preferences.

Once these are parsed, the code can process each section and extract the required information.

For each section:

- Overall Logic gives the rule for access.

- Supports of Perm: list of elements for permissions.

- Support of Probi: same.

- Preferences: a list of relations, each with a relation name and a direction (like 'preference' or 'preferred_to').

Once that's done, we can proceed to build the explanation.

The explanation needs to have:

- Decision Rule: How the decision was made.

- Outcome: What was the result.

- Relations and preferences: The various relations between elements and their preferences.

But for the purpose of the explanation, perhaps it's sufficient to note the key points without going into too much detail.

In any case, let me think of how to represent the data.

In code, perhaps:

- Read the entire input string.

- Split into lines.

- Process each line, extracting the required info.

But perhaps, for this problem, since it's text-based, I just need to process each line as per its content.

So for each line:

- The first line: Overall Logic.

- Lines 2 and 3: Support of Perm and Probi.

- Line 4: Preferences.

So in code:

lines = input().split('\n')

if len(lines) < 1:

    # handle empty case, but problem says input is given.

    pass

else:

    overall = lines[0].strip()

    perm_supports = []

    prob_prohibitions = [] 

    prefs = []

for line in lines[1:]:

    line = line.strip()

    if line.startswith('Overall Logic: '):

        # process overall logic

        pass

    elif 'Supports' in line:

        # extract supports for perm and prob

        perm_support = line.split(': ')[1].split(', ')[0]

        prob_support = ''

        for i in range(1, len(line.split(',')) ):

            if ': ' in line[i]:

                prob_support_part = line[i].split(':', 1)[1]

                if 'support' in probSupport_part:

                    probSupport = ' '.join(probSupport_part.split())

                else:

                    pass

        # store as list

        perms_supports.append(perm_support)

        probs_support = probSupport

        prefs.append( (relation, direction) )

Wait, perhaps this is getting a bit messy.

Alternatively, perhaps for each section, extract all the relevant info.

Wait, but for the problem, perhaps the code is not needed beyond parsing the sections.

But given that the problem expects a structured output, perhaps in the code, each section can be processed as:

- For Overall Logic:

   - The condition is whether for each prob support, exists a perm support where perm support dominates prob support.

   So, the rule is: For each prob_support, find a perm_support such that for each element in perm_support, it strictly dominates the corresponding element in prob_support.

   But how to model this as a decision rule.

   The decision rule would be: For every prob_support in probs, there must exist a corresponding perm_support in perms where for each p_element in perms_support, p_element strictly dominates prob_element.

   Wait, but how is 'dominance' defined?

   From the example explanation, dominance is when each p_elem strictly prefers to prob_elem.

   Hmm, but in code terms, perhaps we need to model the dominance as a partial order.

   Alternatively, perhaps dominance is a binary relation where for two elements a and b, a strictly dominates b if a is preferred over b.

   In the example:

   The relation ""preference"" is such that if a relation is 'preferred_to', then it is a stronger relation than 'preferred'.

   So perhaps, the dominance can be thought of as a directed edge from a to b in a graph, and dominance is the transitive closure of these edges.

   For each a in perms support and b in prob support:

   If a is dominated by b (i.e., a is directly preferred to b), then in the graph, a has an edge to b, and transitive dominance is possible.

   Then, for a to strictly dominate b, it must have a path of length 1 (directly preferred).

   But in the logic, the condition is that for every prob support (b), there exists some perm support (a) such that a is strictly dominated by some element of a.

   Or, perhaps, more precisely, for all b in probs_supports, there is an a such that each a_i is strictly less than b_i in terms of dominance.

   I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the example can help.

   Let me think about the example given.

   According to the sample input and output, the decision is to grant access because Bob can perform a sign.

   Looking at the supports:

   For the permission support, Bob is in several roles, like full professor, etc. The prob support is 'sign' in the context.

   Since Bob's role is strictly more preferred to 'sign', the dominance is satisfied.

   Similarly, for other elements, the same reasoning applies.

   Therefore, in code, the logic is to check for each probabilistic support, whether there's an element in the permutation support that strictly dominates it.

   Now, to represent this, perhaps each permutation support and prob support can be represented as sets of elements, and for each permutation element, check whether it dominates each prob element.

   If for all prob elements, some permutation element dominates it, then access is allowed.

   Thus, for code:

   We can represent each support (perm and prob) as a set of elements.

   We then iterate through each prob_element, and check if any perm_element exists such that perm_element is strictly greater than prob_element (according to the dominance rules).

   If all prob_elements have such a perm_element, then proceed.

   Else, the access is denied.

But how to implement the dominance logic.

The dominance is based on the preferences.

Each relation in the prefs is of the form 'a is preferred_to";0.4597620646158854;0.1731719970703125;0.1573766072591146;0.3115234375;0.90576171875;0.2490234375;0.9297052154195011;58.38;8.3;7.63;11.7;10.43;9.8

        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1909;186;"

The decision was made to grant access to the system. This decision was based on a structured logical inference process that evaluated the conditions outlined in the overall logic section.

### Decision Rule
Access is granted under the condition that for each supporting role of a prohibitive action, there is a corresponding supporting permission whose support strictly dominates the prohibitive support.

### Outcome
The access was successfully granted due to the dominance condition being satisfied across all relevant permissions and prohibitions.

### Relations and Preferences
- **Dominance Conditions**: For each prohibitive role, there was a corresponding permission support that strictly dominated it. This dominance was determined by the provided preferences and relations.
- **Preferences**: The preferences indicated that roles and contexts were preferred over others, which influenced the determination of whether the permission support could strictly dominate the prohibiting support.

The combination of these conditions led to the conclusion that access was allowed, as all required dominance conditions were met.";0.4519374847412109;0.1092681884765625;0.10223197937011719;0.1551513671875;0.93115234375;0.038116455078125;1.0;17.94;15.6;15.76;17.4;17.58;17.6

### Structured Output

**1. Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted based on the condition that for each **support** of a **prohibition**, there must exist a **corresponding support** for a **permission** where the **permission's support** dominates the **prohibited support**. Domination is defined as each element in the **permitted support** being **strictly preferred** to or matching the **denied support**.

**2. Outcome:**  
The access was **granted** because all conditions of the decision were satisfied, specifically meeting the requirement that the permission support elements strictly dominate the prohibitions' support elements.

**3. Relations and Preferences:**  
- **Permission Support Elements:**  
  - The role assigned to **Mia_Anderson** in **team_leader** is preferred over the role assigned in **staff_member** due to the preference relation between these two roles.
  - This preference is influenced by the audit holding between specific attributes, which is considered a part of the reasoning process.

- **Prohibition Support Elements (Context):**  
  The condition that the **context audit holds** between certain attributes (e.g., create, dataset6) within the University2 organization is a key factor in determining the feasibility of granting the permission.

**Conclusion:**  
All conditions for granting access were satisfied through the dominance of permission supports over prohibitions, ensuring that the access granted was consistent with the logical reasoning and preferences outlined in the input.";0.6848770141601562;0.24371337890625;0.24371337890625;0.95703125;0.98974609375;0.00981903076171875;0.9660194174757282;23.46;15.5;16.48;17.1;17.24;20.3

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2855;218;"

To determine whether the access decision was granted, we analyze the given logic and structure. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

### Decision Rule
Access is granted based on the condition where for every supporting role (prohibition) of a non-permissible activity, there corresponds a supporting permission whose role strictly dominates the prohibited activity's role.

### Outcome
The access was **granted** because all supporting roles of prohibitive activities were strictly dominated by the corresponding supporting permissions.

### Relations and Preferences
- **Domination Conditions**: Each element of a prohibited support role was strictly preferred (dominated) by a corresponding element in a permissible support role.
- **Preferences**:
  - Context preferences: Context management holds over context collaboration, audit holds over collaboration.
  - Role preferences: Role post_doc over role wp leader, context postdoc over context default.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1598;252;"

To determine whether the access should be granted, we analyze the given logic and preferences step by step.

### Decision Rule
For each support (prohibition) of a task, there must exist a corresponding permission whose support dominates that of the task. This means that every element in the task's support must be strictly dominated by the corresponding element(s) in the permission support.

### Outcome
The access is **granted** because all relevant conditions have been met, ensuring that the permissions' supports dominate the prohibitions' supports.

### Relations andPreferences
- **Permission Support Dominates Prohibition Support:**
  - The permission support includes elements such as ""sign"" and ""dataset4.""
  - These elements are strictly dominated in their respective supports:
    - ""sign"": Dominated by ""sign,"" as it is identical to the task support's ""sign."" However, in the context of domination, identical elements do not violate the condition since dominance requires each element to be strictly preferred.
    - Similarly, "" dataset4"" is identical and thus strictly dominated.
  - Additionally, the context preferences ensure that the task supports are preferred over prohibitions.

### Conclusion
By meeting the domination condition for all task supports, the access is successfully granted.";0.500396728515625;0.0623321533203125;0.0623321533203125;0.44140625;0.955078125;0.0191650390625;0.968421052631579;27.93;13.8;14.09;16.0;16.01;16.6

### Output:";2223;285;"

### Structured Output:

**1. Decision Rule:**  
The decision is based on the condition that for each 'support' of a 'prohibition', there must exist a 'corresponding support' of 'a permission' where the 'permission's support' dominates the 'prohibited support's'. Dominance is defined as each element in the permission support being strictly preferred.  

**2. Outcome:**  
In this case, the outcome is that the access for 'the permission' (Frank_Harris performing 'add' on 'agreement3') is granted due to the dominance condition being satisfied across all relevant 'supports'.  

**3. Relations and Preferences:**  
- The relation ""The organisation institutes employes..."" is preferred over ""the organisation universities employes"" due to 'researcher' being preferred to 'secondee'.  
- Similarly, other preferences are established between different 'elements' (e.g., roles, contexts, etc.) to determine the dominance conditions.  

---

### Explanation:

The decision rule is applied to determine access based on dominance conditions between 'supports' of prohibitions and permissions. For each support, a corresponding permission support must dominate the prohibited support. This is achieved by establishing preferences between different elements, such as roles and contexts, which influence the dominance of permissions over prohibitions. In this example, all dominance conditions are satisfied, leading to the granting of access.";0.6215510050455728;0.15180460611979166;0.1386896769205729;0.97900390625;0.98583984375;0.1475830078125;0.9639175257731959;22.92;13.7;13.84;15.3;16.7;16.3

**Decision Rule:**
Access is granted based on the condition that for each ""support"" of a ""prohibition,"" there must exist a ""corresponding support"" for a ""permission"" where the ""permission's support"" strictly dominates the ""prohibited support.""

**Outcome:**
The permission for ""Paul_Harris"" to perform ""copy"" on ""dataset6"" is granted due to the dominance condition satisfied across all relevant supports.

**Relations andPreferences:**
1. For each support in the prohibitions:
   - The permission support (e.g., ""full_professor,"" ""post_doc,"" etc.) must strictly dominate the prohibited support.
   - Dominance is determined by comparing each element in the permission support to the corresponding prohibited support, using the provided preference relations.

2. The decision rule ensures that if all supports of prohibitions are dominated by the respective supports of permissions, access proceeds.

---

**Step-by-Step Explanation of the Example:**

### Step 1: Identify the Decision Rule
The decision rule states that access is allowed only if for every prohibition support, there's a corresponding permission support that strictly dominates it. Domination is defined as each element being strictly preferred (as per the given preferences) to the prohibited element's support.

### Example Decision Rule:
Access granted if for each prohibition support element, a matching permission support exists where each element is strictly more preferred than the corresponding prohibition element.

### Application to the Example:

#### Step 2: Analyze Each Support
- **Prohibition Support 1 (University1):**
  - Elements: ""context audit holds""
  - Domination Condition: Need a permission support element that strictly prefers this context.

  - Found in Permissions:
    - Permission Support: ""organizational University1 employs Paul_H Harris in role 'secondee'""
    - Comparison: ""seconee"" (from University1) is preferred over ""default"" (in University1). Thus, dominance is satisfied.

- **Other Prohibition Supports (Institute1, consortium, University3):** Similar analysis is performed for each, ensuring each prohibited context is dominated by a suitable permission support.

#### Conclusion:
Since all prohibited contexts are strictly dominated by respective permission supports, access granted.

### Final Answer
The access decision is based on strict dominance of prohibited contexts by permission supports. All prohibited contexts were successfully dominated, granting access.";0.657403564453125;0.2746124267578125;0.2746124267578125;0.900390625;0.9755859375;0.13818359375;0.9850299401197605;19.67;14.9;12.87;16.7;18.09;18.7

An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.

        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";2622;177;"

The decision rule is based on the condition that for each supporting role of a prohibitive task, there must exist a corresponding supporting role in a permissible task where the permissible task's role strictly dominates the prohibitive role's role. This domination is determined by strict preference relations between elements.

The outcome is that the permission to perform `read` on `dataset9` is granted due to the dominance of the permissible role over the prohibited role.

Relations and preferences:
- The permission role for `Mia_Anderson` in `role coordinator` is preferred over the prohibiting role `post_doc` due to `coordinator` being preferred over `postdoc`.
- The role `role post_doc` is dominated by `role read` because `reads` strictly dominates `postdocs`.
- Similarly, other preferences and domination relations are considered, leading to the conclusion that access is authorized.";0.6446824815538195;0.20865885416666666;0.14369032118055555;0.96826171875;0.95068359375;0.047882080078125;1.0;24.27;15.2;16.04;16.9;15.49;17.3

To get started, I need to break down the given problem into smaller parts and tackle each part step by step. First, I'll try to understand the overall structure of the problem and identify the key components that are involved in determining the access decision.
Alright, I'm going to start by reading through the problem statement and the example provided to get a clear understanding of what needs to be done. The problem is about determining whether access to a certain system is granted based on some logic involving permissions and prohibitions. 

The overall logic is given in the example input, which explains how access is determined. It mentions that access is successful if for each supporting role of a prohibitive role, there's a corresponding supporting permission that dominates it. Domination means each element in the permission support must be strictly preferred. 

Looking at the supports of the permissions and the prohibitions, I can see that each support is a list of elements. For each of these supports, we need to check if there's another support (a permission) that dominates the prohibitive support. 

I also need to consider the preferences between the elements, which are given as relations where one element is preferred over another. These preferences will influence whether the dominance condition is met. 

In the example, the decision was granted because both the role assignments and context preferences were satisfied, leading to the permission being granted. 

So, to approach the problem, I think I should:

1. Identify all the support elements for each permission. These are the elements listed in the supports_of_permission lists.
2. Identify the supports (prohibitions) that need to be dominated by these permissions.
3. Check for each prohibited support whether a corresponding permission support exists that strictly dominates it.
4. Use the given preferences to determine if the dominance is possible.
5. If all prohibitive supports are dominated by the corresponding permissions, access granted.

Now, let me try to apply this to the provided input. 

First, the overall logic tells me that the decision is based on the condition that for each prohibition support, there must be a permission support where the permutation (dominance) condition is satisfied. 

Next, I will list all the supports for permissions. There are three supports of permission: support 1, support 2, and support 3, each with their own elements. 

Then, I look at the prohibits' supports. Each support is also given, so I have three prohibitions as well.

I need to go through each support and check if it is dominated by any permission support.

Let's take the first support of permission. Its elements are: ""The organisationUniversity1 employs XanderRodriguez..."" etc. The prohibitions' first support is similar, but with different elements. So, for the first permission support, I have to see if each of its elements is strictly dominated by some element in a prohibitions support.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of each element. For example, if a permission's element is ""Xander"" in the support, and a prohibition's support has an element ""Bob"" which is more dominant, then it's dominated.

I think I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should map each element and see if it's strictly dominated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to represent each support as a set of elements, and for each element, check whether it is strictly more dominant than the corresponding element in prohibitions.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

The decision rule says that for access to be granted, each support (prohibition) must have a corresponding permutation (permission support) where each element is strictly dominant in the permutation.

So, for example, let's say we have a support (permutation) of a prohibited role, which is [A, B, C]. We need to find a permutation of permissions such that each of A is strictly greater than some element, B strictly greater, etc.

But perhaps a better way is to model each element's dominance as a relation, and then for each permutation, check if each element can be matched in a way that satisfies the dominance.

But maybe that's overcomplicating. Let's try to proceed step-by-step.

Let me list out all the permutations (support elements) for both prohibitions and permissions.

For the permissions:

- Support 1: [X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, X8, X9, X10] (each of these is a role assignment or similar)
Wait, looking back at the input, the supports are:

Support 1 for permission: includes ""The organization ... in role full professor"", etc. So each element here is a specific role or designation.

Similarly for others.

For prohibitions:

Supports are similar but with ""Prohibition"" instead of ""Permission"".

So for each prohibition support, we have elements like ""Bob"", ""edit"", ""report1"", etc.

Domination means that for the permutation of the prohibited support, each element must strictly dominate the same position in a permutation from the permissions.

So for a given prohibitions permutation [X, Y, Z], we need a permission permutation [P1, P2, P3, ...] such that X > P1, Y > P2 (if applicable), Z > P3 (and so on). 

Wait, but the domination is per element, not per position. So for each position i, the i-th element of prohibitions must dominate the corresponding position i of permission.

So if prohibitions have [A1, A2, A3], and permission has [B1, B2, B3], then for domination, A1 must dominate B1 (i.e., A1 is strictly better than B1), A2 must strictly prefer to B2 (A2 > B2), and A3 > B3. If any of these are not true, then the domination doesn't hold for that position.

Therefore, the condition is that for every i, prohibitionsSupport[i] strictly dominates permissionSupport[i].

So the plan is:

For each i from 1 to n (where n is the number of elements in each support):

1. Check if prohibitionSupport[i].dominates(permissionSupport[i]).

2. If for any i, it's not dominated, then access is denied.

3. Else, if for all i, domination holds, then check if all the other conditions (like preferences) are met.

But wait, according to the overall decision rule, it says:

Access is granted iff, for all support of prohib, exists corresponding permutation of permission where permission's permutation dominates prohibitions's support.

So regardless of the preferences, as long as for each i, permission's i-th permutation strictly dominates the corresponding i-th of the prohibition, access will be granted.

But then the example shows that even with certain preferences, access can be granted. So perhaps the decision also depends on the preferences influencing whether the domination can be achieved.

Wait no, the example's decision rule doesn't mention anything about preferences. It just states the condition for granting access. So the reasoning is based solely on whether each permutation's elements are strictly dominant.

But in the problem description, it also mentions that preferences between elements influence the decision.

So perhaps, in addition to the domination condition, the preferences also play a role in determining whether the permutation can be formed.

Hmm, that complicates things. So maybe the decision isn't just based on domination, but also on whether the permutations can be chosen such that the preferences are satisfied.

But how?

Let me re-examine the example.

The example input is structured as follows:

- Overall Logic: Conditions for access.
- Supports of Permission: List of support elements (roles, designations, etc.).
- Same for Prohibitions.
- Preferences: Relations between elements, indicating which are preferred over others.

So the decision process is not just about whether a permutation exists, but whether it's possible given the preferences.

In other words, even if a domination exists, it may not be possible to form the permutation if the preferences don't allow it.

So in that case, the problem is more complex. It's not just a matter of checking for each domination; we also have to check whether the preferences allow for such a permutation.

But the example doesn't seem to provide enough details for that. The example only gives the logic and the relations, but perhaps in the actual problem, we might need to model the preferences as a directed graph and check for the existence of certain paths or conditions.

But for the sake of solving this problem, perhaps we can model the problem as a graph where each node is an element, and";0.4940409342447917;0.152923583984375;0.12636311848958334;0.328369140625;0.90478515625;0.042236328125;0.9898403483309144;47.18;10.6;8.62;13.6;11.25;11.1

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output

**Example Input:**
1. Overall Logic:
   - Access granted if for each prohibitive support, there's a corresponding permission support where permission dominates the prohibitive.
   - Dominance: each perm support element strictly preferred over prohibited's support element.
2. Supports of Permission: List of perm support elements.
3. supports of prohib: list of prohib support elements.

**Example Output:**
Here is the structured explanation of the decision process.

**Decision Rule:**
Access is granted based on the condition that for every prohibitive element, there must exist a permission element where permission strictly dominates prohibitive.

**Outcome:**
The permission for ""Wendley-Mitchell"" to perform ""cat"" on ""dataset7"" is granted due to the dominance condition being satisfied across all prohibitive supports.

** Relations and Preferences:**
- **Domination Conditions:**
  - **Role Assignment:**
    - Organizational Institute 1 (EI1) ""employs"" Wendy-Mitchel in ""role coordinator"" is preferred over organizational Institute 2 (EI2)'s ""role post_doc"" because ""coordinator"" > ""post_doc"".
    - Reason: preference between role assignments.
    - EI2's ""role researcher"" is also preferred over EI1's ""postDoc"" because researcher > post_doc.
  - Context Preferences:
    - Secondment preferences hold higher priority than default. For example, ""secondment holds"" is more preferred than ""default holds"".
- **Other Elements:**
   - Both preference relations are satisfied.
- Conclusion: All conditions are met, granting access.

**Final Answer:**
**Decision:** The permission is granted.
**Outcome:** The access granted is based on satisfying the dominance conditions across all prohibited supports.
**Explanation:** The dominance conditions were met by organizational preferences and context preferences, leading to the granting of access.

The decision rule is applied, and the outcome is clear. The relations between roles and contexts, as well as the preferences, all contribute to the final decision. This structured approach ensures clarity and understanding of the reasoning behind the decision.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]

### Output:";1839;406;"

To determine whether the access to the system is granted, we need to analyze the given logic and input. The decision rule is based on the condition that for each supporting role of a prohibition, there must be a corresponding supporting permission whose support strictly dominates the prohibitions' support. This means that every element in the permission support must be strictly preferred over the corresponding element in prohibitions support.

Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. For each **support of a prohibiting role**, we must find a corresponding **support for a permissible role** where the **permissible role's support** dominates the **prohibitory role's** support.
2. If a **dominance condition** is met for all supporting roles of prohibitions, the access is **granted**.
3. The dominance condition is satisfied if each element in a **support** of a **permission** is **strictly preferred** to at **least one element** of the corresponding **prohibition**'s support.
4. All dominance conditions are satisfied, so the access **is granted**.

**Decision Rule:**
Access is granted based on whether for each prohibiting role, there's a corresponding permissible role where the permissible's support dominantly covers the prohibiting's support.

**Outcome:**
The access is successfully granted because all dominance conditions between permissible and prohibiting roles are satisfied.

**Relations andPreferences:**
- For the **permission support elements**:
  - The role ""full_professor"" is preferred over ""post_doc"" in both the University1 and University3 contexts.
  - ""Sign"" and ""report7"" are preferred over other elements as per the given preferences.
- For **prohibited elements** (roles and contexts):
  - Contexts like ""secondment"", ""default"", and ""collaboration"" are prioritized based on their dominance over prohibitions.
- The dominance conditions for each element are met, ensuring the permission to ""perform sign"" is granted through strict dominance in all relevant contexts.";0.69876708984375;0.4774169921875;0.4774169921875;0.65576171875;0.97607421875;0.09283447265625;0.9895470383275261;34.15;13.5;13.16;16.4;15.37;17.3

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports:

        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

To get started, I need to break down the problem step by step. Let's start by understanding what each part of the input represents and how they relate to each other.

First, I'll try to parse the input data correctly. The input is divided into two main sections: the overall logic and the details of the supports. The overall logic gives the condition for granting access. The supports section lists the elements for permissions and prohibitions, along with their supports. Then, the preferences between elements are given.

I think the first step is to understand what each ""support"" represents. A support is a set of elements that perform a certain action. For permissions, these are the roles or attributes that allow someone to perform an activity, like ""perform edit"" or ""contribute to a project."" The prohibitions are the opposite; they are the actions that are not allowed.

The decision rule given in the example says that for each prohibition support, there must be a corresponding permission support where each element in the permission support strictly dominates the elements in that of the prohibitions. Domination means each element is preferred over the corresponding one in the opposite support.

Looking at the example, the supports for permissions include elements like ""secondee,"" ""staff_member,"" ""moderate,"" etc., depending on the role or attribute. Similarly, prohibitions have their own elements. The preferences between these elements determine whether the dominance condition is met.

In the example input, there are multiple preferences. For instance, ""The relation 'The organisation大学3 employessomeone in role researcher' is preferred..."" and so on. These preferences are used to determine the dominance between the supports.

So, to apply this to our problem, we need to:

1. List all the support elements for each permission and each prohibition.
2. For each permission support, check if there's a corresponding prohibition support such that the elements dominate each other.
3. Use the given preferences to determine if the domination condition is satisfied.

Let me try to outline the steps I would take to analyze the given input and determine the outcome.

Step 1: Parse the Input

The input is structured as follows:

- Overall Logic: This defines the conditions for access. It mentions the condition in terms of each support and the dominance required.

- Supports of Permission: This lists all the elements (supports) for permissions. Each element is a role, attribute, etc., and its support is the set of roles it can perform.

Similarly, for Prohibitions.

- Preferences Between Elements: A list of relations where each relation is a preference of one element over another. These relations are based on the context of the problem, such as which role is preferred (e.g., 'researcher' is better than 'post_doc').

The overall logic defines the condition: For each support (permission support) of a prohibited (i.e., each prohibition), there must exist a permission support in which each element strictly dominates (is preferred to) the corresponding elements of that support in the forbidden (prohibition's) support.

Wait, no. Let me read the overall condition again.

The condition is: for each **support** of a **prohibition**, there must exists a **corresponding** **permission** support where the **permission's** support **dominates** the **prohibited**'s.

Domination is defined as each element being strictly preferred.

So the condition is:

For every s in ProhibitionSupports:

   There exists t in PermissionSupports such that for all e in t, e is strictly dominated by the corresponding element in s.

But wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. It says for each s of a prohibition, exists t of permission where t dominates s. So for every s (support of the prohibited), there is a t (a support of permission) such that t's elements strictly dominate s's elements.

So each s is a support for the prohibition. We need to find for each such s, a t in the permissions' supports that dominates it.

If for all such s in prohibitions' supports, we can find such t in permission's supports, then access is allowed.

Otherwise, it's denied.

So now, how do we model this?

We can model each support as a list of elements, each of which has a preference relation over other elements.

For example, in the overall input, some relations are given like 'The relation ... is preferred...' which defines the preference order between elements.

These relations can be used to model the dominance.

So for each element e in a support s, we have a relation e R f where R is the preference (like 'preferred to') between e and f.

So to say that e dominates f is equivalent to f R e, meaning e is preferred above f.

Thus, for the condition to hold for a given s (prohibited support), we need for each e in s, to find an element f in t (permission's support) where f is dominated by e, i.e., for each position i, f_i R e_i.

If such a t exists for all s in the prohibited support, then it's allowed.

Now, let's think about how to model this.

We can create a graph where each node is an element, and edges represent the dominance relation. But perhaps it's easier to represent the relations as a dictionary mapping each element to its preferred relation.

Alternatively, perhaps we can precompute for each permutation of elements in each support, whether the permutation satisfies the condition.

But given that the number of elements can be up to, say, 10 or more, this could be computationally intensive.

But in the problem statement, the example shows that it's manageable.

So perhaps for the given problem, each support can be broken down into elements, and for each, the relations are known, and we can check for each prohibited support whether a matching permission support exists.

So let's outline the plan.

1. Parse the Overall Logic to get the condition:

   The condition is that for every prohibited support (s), there exists some permission support (t) where for all positions i, t_i strictly dominates s_i.

   Domination is as per the preference relations.

   So the condition can be rephrased as:

   For all i, the i-th element of t is strictly better (according to the relations) than s_i's i-th.

   Wait, no: according to the condition, each t_i must be strictly preferred over s_i. So t_i R s_i for all i.

2. So, to model each element's preference, perhaps create a dictionary where for any two elements a and b, we know whether a R b.

   For example, if 'r' is a preferred to 'p', then r > p.

   Then, for any given s and t, to check if for each i, s_i R t_i.

3. So the plan is:

   a) For each s in S_prohibitions (supports of prohibitions):

      i) Check if for every t in S_permutations (each permutation of t's support):

         For each i in 0..n-1:

             Check if s[i] R t[i]

         If for any i, this is false, then t is not suitable for s.

      ii) If for all t, s is dominated, then s is acceptable.

   b) If any s is not dominated by any t, then overall access is denied.

   c) Else, if all s are dominated by some t, access granted.

But this seems computationally heavy, but perhaps manageable for small support sizes.

Given that the example is manageable, perhaps the problem expects us to model it this way.

So in the given example, each s (which is a permutation) is checked against each t (another permutation) to see if for all elements, t's element dominates s's element.

But for the problem's structure, perhaps each support is just a list (not necessarily a permutation), and the question is whether any element of s can be matched with t in such a way that all elements in t are strictly better than s's.

Wait no, the problem says:

""Each element of permission support dominates each corresponding element of prohibition support.""

So for a specific s (permutation of elements of a support) and t (also a permutation of another support's elements), we check whether for every i, e_i (from t) strictly dominates e'_i (from s), where e_i is in t and e_i' is in s at the same position.

If this is true for all permutations, then the condition holds.

So this is a per-s check.

### Structured Output:

**1. Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted based on the condition that for every supporting role of a **prohibition**, there must exist a corresponding **permission** where the **permission's support** strictly dominates the **prohibited** support.

**2. Outcome:**  
The outcome is that the **access is granted** because all supporting roles of the prohibitions are dominated by their respective permissions.

**3. Relations and Preferences:**  
- **Permission Support Dominance:**  
  - For each element in the **support** of the **permission**, there is a corresponding element that strictly dominates it. This is determined by comparing the preferences and relations between the elements.
  - Example: The permission support (Mia_Anderson performing a sign) is dominated by the prohibited support (context secondment holding).
  - Another example: The permutation support (PhD_student performing a Prohibition) is also dominated by another prohibited support.

- **Preferences and Comparisons:**
  - The preference chain shows that certain relations are preferred over others, which influence the determination of dominance between the permission and prohibited supports.

**Conclusion:**  
By analyzing the dominance conditions and considering the preferences between elements, it is determined that the permission support strictly dominates all prohibited supports, thereby granting access.";0.5739761352539062;0.052001953125;0.052001953125;0.791015625;0.986328125;0.01146697998046875;0.9574468085106383;8.77;17.0;15.55;18.5;18.51;20.1

```

To get started, I need to break down the problem step by step. Let me start by identifying the key components.

First, I'll try to understand the overall structure of the problem. The input consists of an ""Overall Logic"" section that explains the condition for access being granted. This logic is divided into two main parts: the supports of permissions and prohibitions, and the preferences between elements. The decision rule is given in the ""Decision Rule"" section of the example.

In the example, the decision was based on whether the permission support dominated the prohibitions support for each element. The outcome was that the permission was granted because all domination conditions were satisfied.

Now, applying this to the given problem, let me outline the steps I should take.

Step 1: Break down the input into manageable parts.

1. The overall logic is split into two parts: for permissions and for prohibitions.
2. Each part is further divided into supports.
3. Preferences between elements are also given.

So, the overall logic has two main sections: one dealing with permissions and another with prohibitions. Each of these sections is broken down into their respective supports. Additionally, there are preferences between different elements, which influence the decision.

I need to parse all these components to understand how the decision is made.

Let me outline each section:

1. Overall Logic:
   a. For Permissions:
      i. Overall logic for permissions.
      ii. Supports of Permission.
      iii. Preferences.
   b. For Prohibitions:
      iv. Overall support.
      v. Preferences.

2. Supports:
   For each support (e.g., support 1, support 2, etc.), list the elements.

3.Preferences Between Elements:
   List of relations and their preferences.

Once I have all this information, I can model the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem, where each element's support must satisfy certain conditions relative to other elements' supports.

The decision rule provided in the example is:

""Access is granted iff, for all support of each prohibition, there's a corresponding permission support where permission support dominates prohibition's support.""

Dominance is defined as each element in permission support being strictly preferred over some element in prohibitions' support.

I can model this as a graph where each node represents an element, and edges represent the dominance relations. Then, the problem reduces to checking if for every node (element) in a prohibition support, there is a node in a permission support that dominates it. If this is true for all prohibitions and their corresponding permissions, then access is allowed.

Given that, the steps to solve the problem would be:

- Parse all the given information into a structured format.
- Build the dominance graph based on the provided preferences.
- For each prohibiting support, check if it has a corresponding permissible support where dominance is satisfied.
- If all are satisfied, access granted; else, denied.

Let's proceed to parse the information.

Starting with the Overall Logic section:

For Permissions:
- Overall logic: similar to the example.
- Supports: list of elements for each permission support.
- Preferences: relations between elements.

For Prohibutions:
- Similar structure, with supports and preferences.

I'll need to extract all these elements and their relations.

Once that's done, the next step is to model the dominance conditions.

I think it's best to model this using a directed graph, where an edge from A to B indicates that A is preferred over B. Or perhaps, since dominance is about whether A is strictly better than B, we can model it as A being preferred to B.

Wait, according to the dominance rule: Each element in the permutation (permission support) must be strictly preferred (i.e., strictly better) to some element (prohibition support). So, for a given prohibiting support (which is a set of elements), we need to find in the permissible support (another set) elements that dominate each prohibiting element. If for every prohibiting element, such a dominating element exists, then it's okay.

But how do we model this? Let's think in terms of graph edges.

Suppose we have a directed edge from element A to element B, meaning A is dominated by B. Wait, no, dominance is the other way around. Because dominance is each element A in the permission must strictly prefer to some B in the prohibiting. So for each A in prohibiting, there must be a B in permissible such that A > B (in terms of preference).

Wait, no. The dominance condition is: for each supporting element A of the prohibition (support_a), there must exist a supporting element B of the permissible (support_p) such that B strictly dominates A.

So for each a in support_a, exists b in support_p where b strictly dominates a.

In terms of the graph, perhaps we can represent this as for each edge a -> b, meaning a is strictly dominated by b. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartite graph where one side is the permission elements and the other is the prohibiting elements. An edge from a to b would mean that a can dominate b, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Maybe it's better to think of each permissible element as a node, and each prohibiting as another node. For each prohibited element a, we must find a permissible element b such that b dominates a. So in the bipartition, we have edges from permissible nodes to prohibited nodes, and for each prohibited node, we need an incoming edge from some permissible node.

But given that in the problem statement, the preferences are given as directed edges, perhaps it's more accurate to model dominance as edges in the reverse direction. For example, if a relation ""A is preferred"" over ""B"" is given, then in our graph, we would have an edge A -> B, but for dominance, we want B to dominate A, which would be an edge B -> A.

Wait no, the dominance is in the sense that if A is more preferred than B (A > B), then for any a in A, any b in B would not dominate a. Wait no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait the dominance condition says: For each element a in the prohibited support (support of the prohibited activity), there exists an element b in the allowed support (the permission) where b is strictly more preferred to a.

Which is equivalent to: for every a in S_p (prohibited support), ∃ b in S_s (permitted support) where a < b (since a is less preferred than b).

So, in the context of our problem, S_p is the prohibited elements, and S_s is the permissible elements.

We need to ensure that for each s_p (each element of S_p), there is an s_s (element of S_s) where s_p < s_s.

In graph terms, this can be represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where edges go from s_p to s_s, indicating that s_p can dominate s_s. But in our case, the condition is the opposite: s_s must dominate s_p. So perhaps the edges should be from s_s to s_p, meaning that s_s is more dominant than s_p.

But perhaps the key is to find for each S_p, whether there exists S_s such that S_s dominates S_p.

So perhaps, for the problem, it's sufficient to model each S_s as nodes and S_p as another set of nodes, with edges from S_s to S_p if S_p can be dominated by S_s.

But regardless, the main idea is to check for all S_p whether there's an S_s that can dominate it.

So the plan is:

- Extract all the permissible and prohibitive elements.
- Create a mapping of each element to a unique identifier (like numbers) for ease of handling.
- Represent each permissible and prohibited element as nodes in a graph.
- Add directed edges from each permissible node to the prohibited nodes it dominates.
- Ensure that for every prohibited node in the input, it is covered by a permissible node that has an edge pointing to it.
- Check if all prohibited nodes are covered by permissible nodes that have edges pointing to them.

But wait, perhaps a more precise approach is needed.

An alternative approach is to represent each permissible support and each prohibited support as sets, and then for each set of prohibited, see if each element can be matched to a permissible set that strictly dominates it.

This seems similar to a problem in constraint satisfaction, where for each constraint, certain conditions must be met.

In this problem, the constraint is: For every prohibited set, each of its elements must be dominated (strictly preferred) by";0.4470316569010417;0.147552490234375;0.13326009114583334;0.415771484375;0.73193359375;0.193359375;0.9742698191933241;55.54;9.4;8.38;13.2;9.86;9.8

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member.

        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Structured Format with Explanation

**1. Decision Rule:**
Access is granted based on the condition that for each supporting role of a **prohibition**, there must exist a corresponding **permission** whose support **dominates** the **prohibited** support. This means each element in the **permission's support** must be strictly more preferred than the corresponding element in **the prohibited support**.

**2. Outcome:**
The access was **granted** because all supporting roles of the prohibitions were dominated by the corresponding roles in the permissions.

**3. Relations and Preferences:**
- **For the first support role of the first prohibition:**
  - The role ""team_leader"" is preferred over ""secondee"" due to the dominance condition.
  - Additionally, the context ""secondment"" holds between ""Bob_Smith"", ""sign"", and ""report1"" in the University1 organization, which is a form of preference.

**4. Detailed Reasoning:**
1. For the **first support role** of **Prohibition 1**:
   - The **permission support** is ""sign"".
   - ""Sign"" is a valid modify activity.
   - Since ""sign"" is part of the ""prohibited support"" (context), the **dominance condition** is satisfied.

2. For other support roles, similar logic applies, ensuring all conditions for domination are met.

**5. Conclusion:**
All support roles of prohibitions are dominated by corresponding permission roles, leading to the granting of access.";0.636322021484375;0.136627197265625;0.136627197265625;0.94677734375;0.9794921875;0.017913818359375;0.985;38.21;11.9;12.86;14.4;14.32;15.8

```

Now, let's try to figure out how to approach this problem.

To solve this problem, I need to analyze the given logic and determine why access was successfully granted. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, I'll look at the overall logic provided. It explains the condition for access being granted. The condition is that for each 'support' of a 'prohibition', there must exist a corresponding 'permission' support where the 'permission's support' strictly dominates the 'proomination's support'. Dominance here means each element in the permission support must be strictly preferred over the corresponding element in prohibitions support.

Next, looking at the supports of permissions and prohibitions. Each support is a list of elements. For each such support, we need to check if there's a corresponding permission support that dominates it.

Then, the preferences between elements are given. These preferences determine which elements are preferred over others. For example, the relation 'full_professor' is preferred over 'associate_professor', etc.

So, to determine the outcome, I have to:

1. Enumerate all the support elements for each prohibition.
2. Check for each permission support whether it dominates the corresponding prohibition support.
3. Use the given preferences to determine if the dominance condition is met.
4. If for all prohibitions, the corresponding permission supports dominate their prohibitions' supports, then access is allowed.

Now, applying this to the given example.

Let me try to outline the steps for the sample input.

1. The overall logic defines the conditions for granting access. It says that for access to be granted, each support (support of a prohibition) must have a corresponding permutation (permission support) where the permutation's support strictly dominates that of the prohibition.

2. The supports of the permissions are given in points 2 and 3 of the input.

3. The preferences between the elements are listed in point 4.

4. The decision rule is given as: access granted if for every prohibition's support permutation, there is a permission support whose support dominates it. Domination is defined as each element being strictly preferred.

5. The outcome is described as the success of granting access because the permissions' supports dominate the prohibitions.

6. The 'relations and preferences' section explains how each relation was used to determine dominance.

Let's go through each step with the sample data.

**Step 1: Decision Rule**

The decision rule in the example is:

""Access is granted iff for each supporting role of a prohibiting role, there corresponds a permutation of a granting permission such that the supporting role's permutation supports strictly dominate the prohibiting role's supporting role.""

In other words, for all permutations of prohibitions (i.e., their support), there must be corresponding permutations of permissions (support) that strictly dominate them.

So the rule is about ensuring that each prohibitive role's support can be dominated by a corresponding permuted permission support.

This is the rule we will use to determine whether access was allowed or denied. If this rule is satisfied for all relevant prohibitions and their corresponding permutations, access will be granted. Otherwise, it will be denied.

In the sample, the rule seems to have been followed because for each prohibited role, a suitable permission support was found that strictly dominated it.

**Wait, but in the sample explanation, the decision was granted because both dominance conditions were satisfied.**

So, perhaps the rule was followed, and the outcome was granted.

Moving on to **Step 2: Outcome**

The outcome is simply stating that the access has been granted. It doesn't provide any additional details, but it's a clear statement of the result based on the previous analysis.

**Relations and Preferences**

Now, for the detailed explanation of how this decision was reached, we'll need to go into the specifics of each step.

Looking at the input data:

- For the permissions (supports of permissions):
  - support 1 includes ""The organization... employs Bob..."" which is a role.
  - The preference for this role is that it's preferred over another role.
  
  Similarly, for other supports.

- The prohibitions have their own supports, which are lists of elements (roles or attributes).

- The preferences are given between all the elements, determining which are preferred.

So let's list all the relations and their preferences.

From the input:

- The relation ""The organisation... employes... preferred to ..."" is given.
- ""The context... holds preferred to ..."" is another relation.

These are the key relations that influence whether the dominance conditions are met.

We need to model these preferences and see how they affect the dominance between the supports.

To do this, perhaps we can create a hierarchy or a scoring system where each element has a score, and these scores determine the dominance.

Alternatively, each preference can be assigned a weight, and when comparing two elements, the one with higher weight is preferred.

But for the sake of this explanation, perhaps it's better to note that each of these relations is used to compare the elements in each support.

For example, when comparing an element from a permission and an element of a prohibit, we use the preference relations to determine which one is preferred, and then check if it's strictly preferred (not tied).

So, for instance, if we have element A from the permission and element B from the prohibit.

We use the relation ""A preferred to B"" to see if A is preferred. If so, then A is considered to dominate B. If not, then B dominates A.

But wait, according to the problem statement, dominance is when each element is strictly prefered. So, if for all elements in A's support (the permission's), each is strictly preferable to the corresponding in B's (the prohibit's), then A dominates B.

Wait, no. The problem says: ""each element of A is strictly prefers to B."" So, for A to strictly dominate B, every element in A must strictly prefer to every element of B.

But in our case, the supports may have multiple elements. So for each position in the support, the element from A must be preferred to the element in B.

So for example, if A has elements A1, A2, A3, and B has elements B1, B2, B3, then for dominance, A1 must prefer to B1; A2 to B2; A3 to B3.

But if in one position, A's element doesn't prefer B's element, then the support doesn't dominate.

Therefore, the process is as follows:

For each support A of a prohibited role:

   For each position i in A:

      Compare A's i-th element with the i-th position of B's support.

      If for any i, the A_i does not strictly prefer the B_i, then support A does not dominate support B.

      So, proceed to the next support.

   If all positions are dominated, then proceed to check the next prohibited role.

Thus, the key is to find for each A in the prohibited support, whether it strictly dominates each B in the corresponding prohibited support.

So now, to model this, we can represent each support as a list, and each element as a node in a graph, with edges indicating the preference.

Each preference relation can be thought of as a directed edge from A to B, with weight indicating how strong the preference is.

But perhaps a simpler way is to assign a score to each element, where a higher score means it is more preferred.

For instance, each element can have a numerical score, where the higher the score, the more preferred it is. Then, for any two elements A and B, A > B if A's score is higher than B's.

But since we have multiple relations, perhaps each relation can give a certain weight that can be used to compute the overall score.

But this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps for each relation, we assign a numerical value (e.g., 1 to 10), and for any element, the score is the sum of the weights of all relations it is involved in, or something like that.

But given the limited number of relations (as per the input), it's manageable.

In any case, each relation is given, and we can model them as directed edges with weights.

But let's think in terms of how to compute whether support A dominates support B, using the given relations.

For each element A_i in support A, and for each element B_j in support B (same position), we check if A_i has a relation to B_j.

If for any A_i and B_j, A_i is not preferred over B_j via any of the relations, then this support does not";0.6001434326171875;0.48260498046875;0.3085784912109375;0.3603515625;0.91162109375;0.06243896484375;0.9866853538892782;55.54;9.4;8.63;12.9;10.21;10.2

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1806;266;"

### Structured Explanation:

**Decision Process:**
Access is granted based on a logical inference system that evaluates the conditions under which the permissions and prohibitions interact. The decision is governed by a specific rule that combines the dominance of permission supports over prohibitions' supports.

**Outcome:**
The outcome is that the access for the permission to perform `grep` on `report5` is granted due to the dominance conditions satisfied across all relevant support elements.

**Influencing Factors:**
- **Domination of Support Elements:** For each prohibitive support, there is a corresponding permission support that strictly dominates it. This dominance is determined by the preference relations, which prioritize certain roles and contexts over others.
- **Role and Context Preferences:** The dominance is influenced by the precedence of role assignments and context preferences. For instance, roles like `team_leader` are preferred over `phd_student`, and contexts like `secondment` over `default`.
- **Element Dominance:** Each element in the permission support must be strictly preferred (or match) to elements in prohibitions, ensuring a strict hierarchy of dominance.

**Conclusion:**
By evaluating all support elements and applying the defined dominance rules, the system determines that the permission `permission_support` is strictly dominated over the prohibitive `prohibition_support`, thus granting access.";0.5828165690104166;0.12757364908854166;0.12757364908854166;0.73291015625;0.9658203125;0.039794921875;0.9897435897435898;16.12;16.3;17.07;17.9;18.27;19.9

### Output:";1399;307;"

### Structured Output:

**1. Relation and Decision Rule:**  
The decision rule is based on the condition that for each supporting role of a prohibitive condition, there must exist a corresponding supporting permission such that the permission’s support strictly dominates the prohibitive’s support. This rule ensures that all prohibitive conditions are addressed by appropriate permissions.

**2. Decision Outcome:**  
Access was granted because all supporting roles of prohibitions were strictly dominated by the corresponding roles of permissions. Specifically, the permission roles met the required dominance conditions for each prohibitive role, ensuring comprehensive coverage and adherence to the defined logic.

**3. Outcomes and Preferences:**  
- **Domination Conditions:**  
  - The permission role for `post_doc` was dominated by `wp_leader` due to the preference relation between the two roles.
  - Additionally, the context-related conditions were also satisfied, further supporting the granting of access.
- **Preferences Influencing Decisions:**  
   - Preferences between roles and contexts were critical in aligning the permission and prohibitive roles to meet the dominance condition.
   - These preferences ensured that the logical implications of the conditions were correctly applied, leading to the successful grant of access.

### Output:";2675;172;"

Here is an explanation of the decision process:

### Decision Rule
Access is granted based on whether for every element in each prohibitory support, a corresponding element in a permissible support dominates it strictly according to predefined preferences.

### Outcome
The access decision was **granted** because all prohibitory elements were dominated by their respective permissible elements.

### Relations and Preferences
The decision was made using the following key points:
1. Each prohibitory element was mapped to a permissible element.
2. The preference relations between elements were used to determine dominance:
   - Researcher > Secondee
   - Context Aud > Context Def
   etc.
3. By applying these relations, it was confirmed that each prohibitable element was dominated by its corresponding permissible element.

### Conclusion
Since all prohibited elements were successfully dominated by permissible elements, access was successfully granted.";0.44590199788411466;0.093231201171875;0.07920328776041667;0.163330078125;0.9072265625;0.01348114013671875;0.9852941176470589;10.6;16.3;14.51;18.4;17.81;17.5

### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";2199;279;"

The decision rule is based on the condition that access is granting if for every supporting role of a prohibitive support, there is a corresponding supporting permission whose support dominates that of the prohibitive. The outcome is the granting of access because the permissions' support dominates over prohibitions' support, specifically for the role assigned to Bob.
The relations and Preferences include the fact that Bob's role is preferred over other roles, and the context defaults hold are preferred over the context collaborations holds. Additionally, Bob's permissions support dominates Bob's prohibitions support.

Here is the step-by-step explanation of the reasoning process:

1. The decision rule requires that for each prohibitive role, there must exist a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohibiting support.
2. We examined the supports of permissions and prohibitions, identifying the roles and contexts involved.
3. We compared the preferences between the elements, determining which roles or contexts were preferred over others.
4. We found that the role assignments and context preferences influenced the outcome.
5. We evaluated the dominance conditions, determining that the permission support for Bob was strictly dominated by the prohibiting context.
6. This dominance condition was sufficient to grant access.
7. Therefore, the access decision was made to grant permission to Bob for reading on the agreement1.

**Conclusion:** The access was successfully granted due to the dominance of Bob's permission support over his prohibiting context.";0.5290491739908854;0.1357574462890625;0.11489613850911458;0.485595703125;0.98046875;0.07147216796875;1.0;36.49;12.6;13.01;15.2;15.37;15.1

### Output:";1598;366;"

To determine whether the access to the project is granted, we need to analyze the given logic and preferences step by step.

### Decision Rule
The access is **granted** if for every **support** of a **prohibition** (i.e., every element in the support set of the ""prohibition""), there **exists** a **corresponding support** for a **permission** where the **permission's support** **dominates** the **permission**'s support. This domination is defined such that each **element** of the permutation support must be **strictly preferred** to or at least match the **elements** in the **opposition's** support.

### Outcome
The decision outcome is that **access is granted** because all conditions of the logic are satisfied, specifically due to the **domination** of each permutation support over the opposition's support in the context of the given preferences.

### Relations andPreferences
- **Domination of Permutation Support over Opposition's Support:**
  - For each permutation element, there is a corresponding opposition element that is **preferable** to the permutation element.
  - Example: The permutation element ""full_professor"" is preferable to the opposition element ""staff_member.""
  - Similarly, other permutation elements are preferable to their respective opposition elements.
  
- **Preferences Among Elements:**
    - The relation ""The organisation ... employes ..."" is preferred over ""The institute ... employs ..."".
    - Specifically, the preference chain is: ""Full_professor > Staff_member > Post_doc > Post2 > Collaboration > Audit.""
    - This chain of preferences ensures that the domination condition is met for all permutation elements.

### Conclusion
Since all permutation supports are strictly dominated by opposition supports according to the defined preferences, the access is successfully granted.";0.4171875;0.122314453125;0.122314453125;0.2333984375;0.97119140625;0.36328125;0.96484375;19.26;15.1;13.2;16.9;16.88;18.7

        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Structured Output

**1. Relation and Decision Rule**

The decision rule is as follows:
Access is granted based on the condition that, for **every support of each prohibition**, there **exists a corresponding permission support** where the **permission's support** strictly dominates the **prohibition's support**, i.e., each element in the permission support is **strictly preferred** to at **least one element** in the prohibitions' support.

**2. Decision Outcome**

The outcome is that **access is granted** due to the dominance condition being satisfied across all relevant supports.

**3. Explanation of Reasoning**

The reasoning is broken down into the following key points:

- **Overall Structure of the Decision:**
  - For each **support of a prohibiting role**, there must be a corresponding **permission support**.
  - **Domination Condition:**
    - Each element in **the permission support's** domain must be strictly **preferred to** at least **one element** of **the prohibiting support's domain**.

- **Analysis of Each Support:**
  
  **1. Support 1 (Permission Support):**
  The organization **Institute3** grants a **full-professor role** to **Chloe_Walker**. This is preferred over **the University1's PhD-student role** because full-professor is more preferred than PhD.

  **2. Context Management Holds (Prophibition Support):** 
  The context **manages holds** between Chloe-Walkers, edits, and reports. This context preference is used to assess whether the context holds are compatible with the permission requirements.

**Domination Check:**
- The **permission support** (Chloe-Walker) is checked against each **prohibitions support**:
  - The **context management holds** are preferred over the **context default holds** because management precedes default.

**Conclusion:**
Since all **domination conditions** are satisfied, access **is granted**.

**Final Answer:**
The access is **granted** because all domination conditions are satisfied across the relevant supports.";0.5074625651041667;0.130615234375;0.11421712239583333;0.6962890625;0.98974609375;0.3935546875;0.9848484848484849;27.52;14.0;12.63;15.5;16.59;19.1

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";2229;419;"

The decision rule is based on the condition that access is granting if for each permutation of the prohibitions, there is a corresponding permutation of permissions such that the permissions' support dominion over prohibitions' support is satisfied.

The outcome is that the access has been granted.

The relations are as follows:

1. The preference ""The relation ""The organisation institute3 employs Amelia-King ... "" is preferred over the ""context default holds"" relation because ""researcher"" is more preferred than ""phd-student"".
2. Similarly, other preferences are considered, but the key point is that all permutations are satisfied, leading to the granting of access.

The final answer is:

The access was successfully granted because all permutations of permissions support dominate over the corresponding permutations of prohibitions support. This is determined by the structured decision rule and the preferences between elements, ensuring that the conditions for granting access are met.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. Identify the permutations of support elements for both prohibitions and permissions.
2. For each support permutation of a prohibition, check if there's a corresponding permission permutation where each support element is strictly dominated.
3. Use the provided preferences to determine dominance.
4. If all prohibitions are dominated by their respective permissions, grant access.

**Answer:**

The access is successfully granted due to the dominance of each permission support over its corresponding prohibitions. The decision rule ensures that all conditions are met, granting access when all requirements are satisfied.

**Decision Rule:**
Access is granted only if for every permutation of prohibited elements, there corresponds a permutation of permissible elements where each element in the permissible support strictly dominates the corresponding element in prohibitive support.

**Outcome:**
The access decision is successful, as all permutations satisfy the dominance condition.

**Relation and Preference Analysis:**
- For each prohibitive element, the corresponding permission element must strictly dominate it.
- Dominance is determined using given preference relations, where certain elements are preferred over others.

**Conclusions:**
All permutations of permission support strictly dominate the prohibitive supports, thus granting access.";0.6588470458984375;0.318603515625;0.2053680419921875;0.88818359375;0.9765625;0.094482421875;0.9878419452887538;21.09;14.4;12.43;16.4;17.34;16.4

### Output:";2693;160;"

Here is an explanation of the reasoning process:

### Decision Rule
Access is granted under the condition that for every restriction (prohibition) of a prohibited role (support of prohibitions), there exists corresponding support (permission) such that the permission’s support strictly dominates the restriction’s support.

### Outcome
The access decision was granted due to the dominance of each permission support over the respective restriction support, ensuring compliance with the given conditions.

### Relations andpreferences
The decision was influenced by several relations, each evaluated based on their preference hierarchy. Key relations include:
- Context audit holds over context collaboration.
- Full-professor over associate-professor.
- PostDoc over PhD.
- audit over collaboration.

These relations were evaluated to determine the most favorable conditions, leading to the successful granting of access.";0.6078694661458333;0.5147501627604166;0.42327880859375;0.158447265625;0.9873046875;0.04443359375;0.9761904761904762;14.05;15.0;16.38;16.2;18.96;17.4

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

**1. Understanding the Decision Rule**

The decision rule is based on ensuring that for every element of a **prohibition** support, there is a corresponding element in a **permission** support where the **permission's support** strictly dominates the **prohibited support**. This dominance is determined by the given **preferences** between elements.

**2. Summarizing the Outcome**

The outcome is that the access is **granted** because all the conditions of the dominance rule are satisfied.

**3. Detailing the Relations andPreferences**

- **Domination Conditions:**
  - **Role Domination:** The role ""wp_leader"" is preferred over ""secondee"" due to wp_leader being more preferred than seconnee. This ensures that the permission support's role can dominate the prohibitions' role.
  
  Additionally, the role ""list"" in the prohibition support is dominated by the deliverable ""1"" through the context preference ""audit"" over ""collaboration"".

- **Context Domination:**
  
  The context ""wp3"" is dominated over ""wp5"" because the audit preference over collaboration is stronger.

- **Element Domination (No preference needed):**

  The elements in both supports do not require any preference since they are identical.

**4. Conclusion**

Since all conditions of dominance are satisfied, the access granted is valid.

**Final Answer:**

1.Decision Rule: Access is denied if for some support of prohibitions, no corresponding permission support dominates it.
2.Outcome: The access was denied.
3.Relations and Preferences:
   - wp_leader preferred over seconatee.
   - Context audit preferred over collaboration.
   Dominance between roles and deliverables.
   Domination between contexts and prohibitions.
   No preference needed for identical elements.

### Output:";2618;1798;"The following is the expected output:
```
1. Decision Rule: ...
2. Outcome: ...
3. Relations and Preferences: ...
```

To get started, I need to understand the example given. Let's look at the example input and output.

In the Example Input, the first line is the overall logic, which explains the condition for access. Then, the supports of permission and prohibitions are listed. The preferences between elements are given. The decision rule is explained, and the outcome is given.

So, for the problem, we need to process the input, extract the necessary information, and then apply the logic to determine whether access is denied or granted.

Now, let's think about how to approach the problem step by step.

First, I'll need to parse the input. The input consists of several lines, each representing a part of the logic. The overall logic is given in one line, followed by the supports for permission and the prohibitions. Each of these is in separate lines.

Let me outline the steps I'll take:

1. Parse the input and extract the relevant information.
   - Read each line and determine which parts belong to which section (overall logic, permission supports, prohibitions, etc.).
2. For each section, process the information accordingly.
3. Apply the logic rules to determine the outcome.

Let's start with parsing the input.

The overall logic line is straightforward: it's a single line that defines the access condition. It's followed by three sections: supports of permissions, supports of prohibitions.

I'll split the input into these sections.

Once I have these sections, I can process them as follows:

- For each support in the permission list, check if there's a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohib's support.
- If all supports satisfy this condition, access granted; else, denied.

But how do I determine dominance?

Dominance is defined as: for each element in the prohib support, there must be a corresponding element in permission support where each element is strictly dominated. 

Wait, the dominance condition is a bit tricky. Let me rephrase it:

For each element x in the support (prohibition support) of the prohib, there should exist an element y in the corresponding support (permission support) such that y strictly dominates x. 

But wait, according to the problem statement, the condition is: ""each element of... support of permutation is strictly... dominated by...."" So for each x in prop_support, there's some y in perm_support such that x is dominated by y.

Wait, but the way it's phrased in the problem is: 

""each element ... of the permutation's support ... is strictly ... dominated by ... the ... support.""

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as for every x in P (prohibitions support), there exists y in S (permission support) where y dominates x.

So the logic is: for all x in PropSupport, there is y in PermSupport where y is strictly better than x.

But the way the problem explains dominance is in terms of the relation between the elements. So each relation is a preference, which is a directed edge from a to b, meaning a is preferred over b.

So for each relation in the preferences, we can model it as a directed graph, where an edge a->b means a is better than b.

Then, for a given PropSupport and PermSupport, we have to check whether for every element in Prop Support, whether there exists an element in Perm Support that strictly dominates it.

But to model this, perhaps we can create a graph where each node is an element, and edges represent the preferences. Then for each PropSupport element, we check if it has a path in the graph to any PermSupport element.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to represent all elements in a single set, and for each permutation support, check whether each element can be dominated by some element in permutation support.

But perhaps a more efficient way is to model the permutation support as a set of elements, and see if for each such element, whether it can be 'covered' by some permutation support that is strictly dominating it.

So here's the plan:

- Collect all elements from both permutation support and prohibition support.

- Create a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each edge represents the preference relation. For example, if a relation 'a'->'b' exists, then in the DAG, a has an edge pointing to b.

- Then, for permutation support elements, check for each whether it is reachable from any permutation support element via the DAG. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the DAG would represent the hierarchy, and we want to ensure that for each prop support element, it is dominated (i.e., can be reached via a chain of preferences) by some perm support element.

Wait no, perhaps not. The problem statement says:

""Each element of permutation support must be strictly dominated by the corresponding element of perm support.""

But I think I might be misinterpreting that. The condition is for each X in propSupport, exists Y in permSupport such that Y strictly dominates X. So it's not a chain, but for each individual X, find a Y that dominates X.

So perhaps the way to model it is as a bipartite graph between propSupport elements and permSupport elements, with edges representing the dominance relations. Then check if for every propSupport element x, x is connected to some permSupport element y via a path.

But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by building a graph of all elements and then checking for reachability.

But maybe it's easier to model each element as a node in a graph, and add edges based on the dominance preferences.

Once the graph is built, then for each node (element) in the propSupport set, we see if there is a path from that node to any node in the permSupport set. If so, then it's satisfied.

But I'm not entirely sure about this approach. Maybe I should think differently.

Another approach: For each element X in permutationSupport, check that there exists some element Y in permutation Support such that X is strictly less than Y in the dominance hierarchy. But wait, no: the problem says that each X must have a corresponding Y that is 'strictly dominated' by Y. So for X, Y must be in the permutationSupport and Y is strictly greater than X in the hierarchy.

So in the context of the graph, for X to have such a Y, X must be reachable from some Y via the dominance edges.

Thus, the graph approach is correct.

So steps to model:

- All elements from propSupport and prohibSupport are in the same set.

- For all pairs (X, Y) where X and Y are elements, add an edge from X to Y if X is directly preferred to Y.

- Now, build a graph with these edges.

- The permutationSupport elements are the nodes that must each have a path to some permutationSupport node.

If for all permutationSupport nodes X, X is connected via some path to a permutationSupport Y, then access is allowed.

So how to implement this?

First, collect all elements:

propSupport = list of elements from permission support.

propSupport_set = set of these elements.

Similarly for prohibSupport.

probiSupport_set.

Then create all possible edges between these elements as per the preferences.

Then build the graph.

Then for each permSupport node X, see if any permSupport Y is reachable via the graph from X.

If yes for all X, then return 'access granted'.

Else, 'access denied'.

So, now, how to collect the edges.

The preferences are given as a list. Each preference is a relation between two elements, specifying which is preferred.

For example, in the sample input, one of the preferences is 'The organization大学2 employs Olivia_Sott in the ... , ' is preferred ... ' etc.

Each preference is in the form of a relation string 'a->b' indicating that a is considered preferred to b. So in our graph, a will have an edge to b in the direction (a -> b).

So, the plan is:

- Parse all the preferences into a graph structure, where for each preference 'a> b', we add an directed edge a -> b.

Once all edges are added, we model the graph as a DAG (since preferences are transitive? Or not necessarily?).

Wait, no. The given preferences are not necessarily transitive. So perhaps the graph can have cycles, but in reality, the given preferences may not form cycles because of the nature of the problem.

But for our problem, perhaps all cycles can be ignored, as the problem may not have cycles.

But in any case, for our approach";0.41990390353732643;0.0997467041015625;0.09041002061631945;0.1488037109375;0.814453125;0.05389404296875;0.966804979253112;56.66;9.0;7.76;12.0;9.04;8.9

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Structured Output:

1.Decision Rule:
Access is granted based on the rule that for each permutation of the prohibitions' support, there must exist a corresponding permutation of permissions where the permissions' support strictly dominates the prohibits' support.

2.Outcome:
The permission for ""Liam_Taylor"" to perform ""insert"" on ""report6"" is granted due to the dominance condition being satisfied across all relevant permutations.

3.Relations and Preferences:
- The relation ""The Organisation Institute3 employs Liam_Tyler..."" is preferred over the ""Organisation Institute2 employs"" relation because ""researcher"" is considered ""preferred"" to ""staff_member.""
- The context ""secondment holds"" in the ""Institute3"" context is more preferred than the ""default holds"" context in the other organizations, contributing to the overall dominance condition.
- Additionally, the permutation of ""support"" within each organization's support list is considered, ensuring that each permission support element is strictly dominated by the corresponding prohibits support elements.

---

**Explanation:**

The decision process for granting access is based on analyzing the support lists of prohibitions and permissions across different organizations. For each support list of a prohibition, we look for corresponding support lists in permissions. The key rule is that each support element in the permission must strictly dominate (i.e., be strictly preferred) the corresponding support elements in prohibitions. This dominance is evaluated across all permutations of support lists, considering preferences such as the relative importance of roles and contexts.

In the given example, the permission support list for the ""prohibition support"" includes elements that, when compared to prohibitions, show strict dominance. Similarly, the ""permission support"" lists for each organization show elements that dominate their respective prohibitions support. The context preferences and role preferences further influence whether the dominance conditions are met, leading to the successful granting of access.

By systematically evaluating these dominance conditions and considering the preferences between elements, the system ensures that the decision is made in a way that aligns with the defined logic and preferences, ultimately granting access to the specified permission.";0.6858561197916667;0.302734375;0.24818929036458334;0.9765625;0.96044921875;0.05865478515625;0.96875;17.64;15.7;14.74;17.3;18.51;18.8

### Output:";2703;224;"

To determine whether access to the system is granted based on the given logic and input, we analyze the conditions step-by-step:

### Decision Rule
Access is granted for each Prohibtion support if a correspondingPermission support dominates it strictly.

### Outcome
The permission for ""Bob"" to perform ""cat"" on ""report1"" is **granted**.

### Relations and Preferences
- **Prohibitions and Permissions**:
  - **Support1 (Prohi1)**: Role assignments. Corresponding Permission support (Support1) has identical role assignments, meeting the strict dominance condition.
- **Support2 (Pro hi2)**: Another role assignment, matched by the same Permission support, ensuring strict dominance.
- The third Prohi (Support3) also matches exactly with the correspondingPermission, ensuring all conditions are satisfied.

### Conclusion
Since all Prohi supports are strictly dominated by their corresponding Permission supports, **access is granted**.

**Final Answer**
The access is successfully granted due to the dominance of each permission support over the corresponding prohibitions.

        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports:

4. Relation Details:
   - Elements of the permutation: Urc
   - Dominance: Yes
5. Relation Description: The permutation is dominant.

7. Relation Rule: If the permutation is not dominant, this relation does not influence the decision.
8. Relation Conclusion: Not applicable
9. Relation Influence: No
10. Relation Source: Relation 2
11. Conclusion: Access is denied because the permutation does not meet the dominance condition.
12. Reason for Denial:
    - The permutation (Urc in researcher) does not dominate the permutation (post_doc in post_doc).
13. Permitted Permutations: None
14. Denied Permutation: The post_doc permutation
15. Domination Condition: Each element in the permutation must strictly dominate the corresponding element in another permutation.
16. Denial of Domination: Since the post_doc does not strictly dominate Urc, the condition is not met.
17. Overall Decision: Denied
18. Final Decision: Access denied
19. Explanation: The reason for denial is that the permutation of Urc in the researcher role does not satisfy the strict dominance condition required for access.
20. Outcomes:
21. The access was denied due to the permutation not meeting the dominance requirement.
22. The decision was made based on the dominance of one permutation over another.
23. The dominance condition is crucial for granting access, requiring strict dominance for each element.
24. The denial of dominance led to the conclusion that access was not granted.
25. The reasoning behind the denial is the lack of strict dominance in one of the permutations.
26. The final decision was reached by analyzing the dominance relationships between the permutations of the prohibitions and permissions.
27. The result of the analysis was the denial of access, as no strict dominance was found to satisfy the condition.
28. Access was denied.
29. Reasoning:
30. The permutation of ""Urc (researcher)"" in the permission support was not strictly dominated by any permutation in the prohibiting support.
31. Therefore, the access condition was not met, leading to the decision to deny access.
32. No additional reasoning was provided beyond the analysis of dominance relationships.
33. Access denial was reached because the required dominance condition could not be satisfied.
34. No further reasoning was added beyond the dominance analysis.
35. Access denied.
36. Conclusion:
37. Access has been denied as no permutation of prohibitions strictly dominated the corresponding permutations of permissions.
38. The domination condition was the critical factor in determining the final decision.
39. The absence of dominance made the condition unmet, resulting in access being denied.
40. No explanation of the reasoning beyond the application of dominance rules was provided.
41. Final decision: Access was granted.
42. Sorry, I'm confused.
43. Let me try again.
44. Wait, I think I got mixed up. Let's go step by step.
45. First, the overall logic is clear. Access is given when for each prohibition support, there's a corresponding permission support that strictly dominates it.
46. So, I need to check each permutation.
47. For the example input, the permutations are:
48. Supports of Permission:
49. (support1): Organisation University1 employee Urc as researcher in permission support.
50. (supports): Organisation Institute2 grant post_doc in permission.
51. (other supports not relevant)
52. Permutations of Prohibitions:
53. (permutation1): Organ University1 grant researcher in prohib.
54. (perm2): Organ Institute2 ... etc.

55. Now, the relations between the elements are as follows:
56. ""The relation ""Organ University1 ... "" is preferred"" to ""Organ Institute2 ...""
57. Because researcher is better than post_doc.
58. Similarly, ""context audit holds"" is better to ""context default holds"" because audit is better.

59. So for each permutation in prohib, we need to find a permutation in permission where each element is strictly dominated.

60. For permutation1 (perm1) in prohib:
61. Organ U1 researcher in perm.
62. Need to find perm in perm support where researcher is dominated.
63. Looking at perm support:
64. perm1 in perm supports researcher (from perm1).
65. perm2 in perm: post_doc from perm2.
66. perm3 in perm not relevant.

67. So to dominate perm1, perm support must have researcher.

68. In perm support, perm2 has post_doc.

69. But post_doc is worse than researcher.

70. So perm1 cannot be dominated by perm2.

71. Hence, perm1 is not dominated.

72. So access is denied.

73. So the reasoning is that permutation1 in prohib doesn't have a corresponding permutation in perm that dominates it.

74. So final decision is access denied.
75. Sorry for the confusion.
76. I think that's correct.
77. Yes, because permutation1 can't be dominated.
78. Thus, access denied.

**Decision Rule:**
Access is denied if for any permutation of a prohib, there is no corresponding permutation of permissions that strictly dominate it.

**Outcome:**
The access decision was to be denied because permutation 1 of prohib did not have a strictly dominating permutation in permissions.

**Relations andPreferences:**
- The permutation ""Organ U1 ... researcher"" was preferred over ""Organ I2 ... post doc"" because researcher is more preferred than post doc.
- The condition for permutation1 not being dominated was checked, and since perm2 (post doc) did not dominate researcher, permutation1 was not dominant.

**Conclusions:**
Since permutation1 did not receive a dominating permutation from permissions, access was denies.";0.4984619140625;0.526611328125;0.526611328125;0.1756591796875;0.390625;0.127197265625;0.9740406320541761;44.1;9.7;6.91;12.6;11.92;10.3

Now, let's think about how to approach this problem.

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It's about determining whether access to a system is granted based on certain conditions involving permissions and prohibitions. The input provides the overall logic, the supports of permission and prohibiting, and the preferences between elements. The task is to explain how the decision was made, using the provided structured format.

To approach this, I'll need to break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Understand the Overall Logic
The overall logic is given in the example input. It explains under what conditions access should be granted. The rule is that for each supporting role of a prohibition, there must be a corresponding supporting permission where that permission's role dominates the prohibition's role. Domination is defined as each element in the permission support being strictly preferred.

So, the logic is: For every support in the prohibitions, check if there's a matching support in permissions where each element is preferred. If this holds for all prohibitions' supports, then access is allowed.

But to understand why, we need to look at the specific supports and their preferences.

Looking at the input, the example has two supports for permission and two for prohibiting. Each support is a list of elements, and there are preferences between these elements.

In the example, the relations are:
- The relation ""The organisation ..."" is preferred over others.
- Context audit holds > context collaboration.
- Team_leader > staff_member.
- Sign is better than dataset2.

These relations influence whether the dominance condition is met.

So to model this, we can represent each element and its preferences, and then for each prohibition support, see if we can find a permission support that dominates it, considering the preferences.

Let's outline the steps:

1. List all the supports for permissions and prohibiting.
2. For each support in prohibitions:
   a. Check if there is a corresponding permission support where each of its elements is strictly dominated.
   b. To dominate, each element must be strictly preferred.
3. If for every prohibitions support, such a permission exists, access granted. Else, denied.

Now, the challenge is to model the preferences and determine the dominance.

Let me try to formalize this.

Each element can have a preference relation with others. For example, 'A' is better (preferred) to 'B', which is better to 'C', and so on.

We can represent these preferences as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where an edge from A to B means A is preferred (dominated) over B.

Domination in the context of the logic means that for a given support (set of elements) in a prohibited role, we must find a support in a permission such that for every element in prohibited support, it is dominated by the corresponding element in permission support.

In other words, for a prohibited support P and permission support Q, P must dominate Q if for every x in P, x is dominated in Q.

Wait, no. Wait, the condition is: for each x in the prohibited support's elements, there's some y in Q's elements such that y is dominated over x. But the wording in the problem says: 'each element of Q is strictly prefered to ...'

Wait, the problem statement says:

""Dominance means that:

each element ... of the permutation of the prohibited's support.

Thus, for Q to dominate P, for all elements in P (the prohibited support), there exists an element in Q (the permission support) such that Q's element dominates P's element.

Wait no, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me read the problem again.

The problem says:

Dominance means: Each element of permission support (Q) strictly prefers to an element of prohibited support (P). So for every q in Q, there is some p in P such that q is strictly better than p.

But wait, no: it's the other way around. The condition is for each P (prohibited support) to have a corresponding Q (permission support) where Q dominates P. So for each p in the set of P, find a q in the Q support where q dominates p (i.e., q's element is strictly more preferred than p's element).

Wait, but the problem's condition is phrased as: For each P, exists a Q where Q's support strictly dominates P.

So it's not for each Q to strictly dominate all Ps, but for each individual P, to find a Q that strictly dominates it.

So the process is:

For each P in prohibited supports:

   Find a Q in permission supports where for each element x in Q:

      There exists some element y in P where y is strictly less preferred than x.

   Or, more precisely, for the entire P, Q must be such that every element of P is dominated (strictly preferred) by some element in each corresponding position in Q?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's refer back to the example.

In example input:

- For the first support of prohibitions (support1), which is: ""The organization... grant the role ..."".

- For permission supports, there are two: support1 (role assignment) and support2 (role post_doc).

In the preferences, the relation 'The organisation... employes ...' is preferred because 'team_leader' > 'staff_member'.

So in support1 of permission, the role is 'secondee', and the support2 is 'post_doc'.

So for the first P, which is 'support1' of prohibiting (which has 'role assignment'), we need a Q support in permission where for the role assignment, each role in the support1 is dominated.

In support2 of permission (post_doc), each role is checked against support1.

So for support1, role assignment:

In permission support1: role assignment is 'role_secondee'.

In support1's prohibitions: 'role_team_leader' (from support1), 'role_post_doc' (support2), and 'context audit holds'.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps the way to model it is as follows:

Each support for permission can be thought of as a set of elements. Each element has a 'preference' relation to other elements.

For a given P (a support of prohibiting), and Q (support of permission), Q must dominate P if for each X in P's support (X is a role assignment or similar), there's an element Y in Q such that Y is strictly preferable to X.

But since P and Q are sets, perhaps we can model this as for each permutation of P's roles, Q's roles must dominate each corresponding role in P.

But I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the example and see how the dominance is achieved.

In Example Input:

- The prohibitions have two supports, each with their own elements.

- The permissions also have their own supports.

For each of these prohibitions supports, we check if the corresponding permission supports can dominate them.

For example, in the first prohibited support:

- It has elements: role_team_leader, role_post_doc, and context Audit holds.

We need to see if any permission support can dominate this.

The permission supports are:

support1 (Q1): role assignment.

support2 (Q2): role postdoc.

So Q1 and Q2 are the only permission supports.

So let's see:

For P1 (the first prohibitions's support):

P1 consists of three elements: team leader, post doc, context audit hold.

In Q1, the support is role assignment (team leader).

In Q2, it's role post doc (post doc).

So for P1 to be dominated by a Q, each of P1's elements must be dominated in their respective positions.

Meaning, for team leader in P1, does Q1 or Q2 have a role that strictly prefers team leader over team leader? Well, Q1 has role assignment as team leader. So team leader is preferred by Q1.

Similarly, for post doc: Q2 has post doc. So post doc is preferred in Q2.

For context audit: Q1 doesn't have context, Q2 doesn't. So context is not dominated by any permission.

But according to the logic, for access to be granted, each P must have a Q which dominates it. But in this case, P1 has a third element (context audit) which isn't dominated. So perhaps the access is denied.

But the example says that access was successfully granted. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait the example's decision rule is";0.502496337890625;0.1960906982421875;0.1960906982421875;0.3095703125;0.90966796875;0.09893798828125;0.9897735573411249;57.27;8.8;7.5;12.0;9.27;9.0

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support:

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

Now, let's think about how to approach this problem step by step.

First, I need to understand the overall structure of the problem. The problem is about determining whether access to certain projects is granted based on the permissions and prohibitions of those projects. Each project has a set of support elements for its permission and for its prohibitions. The decision rule is such that for each prohibitory support, there must be a corresponding permission support where each element in the permission support strictly dominates the elements of that support in the prohibitory.

Dominance is defined as each element being strictly preferred. So, for a given permission support element, each of its elements must be strictly preferred over the corresponding element in a prohibitory's support.

To model this, I think we need to:

1. Identify all the support elements of each permission and each prohibition.
2. Define the dominance relation between these elements.
3. For each prohibitive support, check if there's a permission support that dominates it.
4. If all prohibitive supports are dominated by some permission support, then access is allowed. Otherwise, it's denied.

So, the first step is to parse the input and extract all the necessary information.

Looking at the example input, the overall logic is given with an explanation of the condition for access. The input is structured into three sections: 1) Overall Logic, which explains the condition; 2) Supports of Permission, which lists the elements for each permission support; 3) supports of prohibitions, which list the elements. Then, the preferences between the elements are given.

In the example, the supports of permissions are for each role (coordinator, team leader, etc.), and the prohibitions are similar but with different roles and contexts. The preferences are given as well, which determine which elements are preferred over others.

The decision rule in the example is that access is given if for every prohibitory, there is a permission whose support dominates it. The outcome is that the permission to perform 'drop' on 'dataset5' is granted, and the reasoning is based on dominance and the given preferences.

Now, for the problem, I'll need to process the input, extract the necessary data, define the dominance relations, and then check the condition.

Let me outline the steps I'll take to solve this problem.

1. Parse the Input:
   - Read the Overall Logic section.
   - Extract the list of supports for permissions (each support is a list of elements for a role).
   - Similarly, extract supports for prohibitions (each list is a role's support for the prohibition).
2. Collect All Elements:
   Identify all unique elements from the permission and prohibition supports.
   These elements are the ones that need to be compared for dominance.

3. Define Dominance Rules:
   For each element, determine which other elements it is preferred over.
   This can be done by looking at the preferences given in the input.

4. For Each Prohibition Support:
   Check if each element is dominated by any permission support.

5. If All Prohibitions Are Dominated, Access is Granted. Else, Denied.

But wait, how exactly do we model the dominance? Let's think.

Each element can have a preference over another. For example, element A may be preferred to element B, meaning A is better than B.

We can represent this as a directed graph, where an edge from A to B means A is dominated over B.

Wait, no. Wait, in dominance, if A dominates B, then for any element in A, it is strictly better than in B. So for each element x in A's support and y in B's support (where B is a subset of A), x is strictly preferable to y.

So for each pair (x, y) where x is in A and y is in B, x must be preferred over y.

But how do we compute this for all pairs?

Wait, perhaps it's better to represent the dominance in terms of a partial order. Each element can be assigned a rank, and if x is ranked higher than y, then x dominates y.

Alternatively, we can represent for each x and y, whether x is better (prefers) than y.

Then, for any x in a support, and any y in another support, if for all elements in x, they are better than the corresponding y in the same position, then dominance is achieved.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think of a way to model this.

I think the way to proceed is as follows:

- For each permutation of the supports (i.e., for each position in the support list), check whether for each corresponding element, the preference holds.

For example, if a support is [x1, x2, x3] and another is [y1, y2, y3], then for dominance, x1 must prefer to y1, and x2 to y2 and x3 to y3.

If this is true for all positions, then the support's elements dominate the other's.

So the steps would be:

For each support in prohibitions:

   For all possible permutations of the same length as the support in permissions:

      Check if for each i, the i-th element in prohibition support is preferred by the permission element.

      If for all i, this holds, then it's a success for this permutation.

      Once a permutation is found where all elements are dominated, we don't need to check further for this support.

   If none of the permutations for a prohibitions support are found, then that support is not dominated, so access is denied.

Proceeding this way, for all prohibitions supports, if each has a permutation that satisfies the dominance condition, then all is well, access granted.

Else, access denied.

Thus, the key steps are:

- Enumerate all permutations of all possible support lengths.

- Check for each permutation whether the dominance holds.

- If any permutation fails, proceed to the next support.

- Only if all supports are successfully dominated, then return access.

So now, the plan is to implement this logic.

Let's outline the code structure.

We'll need:

- A data structure to represent each support (e.g., as a list).

- A way to generate all possible tuples (permutations) of a given length.

- A dictionary to map each element to its preferred rank.

But perhaps, instead of using ranks, we just need to know for any two elements, which is preferred.

Given that, perhaps we can create a dictionary where for any pair of elements, we know which one is preferred. If one is not in the dictionary, it defaults to the other.

But in Python, perhaps the easiest way is to create a function that takes two elements and returns the preferred one, or raise an error if they are incomparable.

Wait no, because according to the problem statement, each relation is given as a preference, and we can use these to determine the dominance.

So perhaps, for two elements a and b, we have a relation r(a, b) which is either a, b, or something else, but given the problem's context, perhaps each pair has a clear direction.

But for the sake of the code, perhaps for any a and any b, if r(a,b) is a, then a is preferred; if r(b,a) is b, then b is preferred, else, perhaps they are considered incomparable, but in our problem, perhaps all elements can be compared via the given relations.

But let's proceed.

So steps for the code:

Read the input:

- First, read the Overall logic section, which gives the condition. But for the rest of the processing, perhaps this is not needed.

- Then, process the next three sections:

  a. The supports of permission.

  Each support is given in a list, e.g., for support 1: [element1, element2, ...].

  So, collect all these elements into a set.

  Similarly, for supports of prohibits.

  b. The relations between elements.

  For each relation, it specifies a preference between two elements. So we can build a dictionary, say, pref, where pref[a] = b if a is considered preferred to b.

  Wait, but the problem says:

  ""The relation `...` is preferred...""

  So for example, pref['a'] = 'b' indicates that 'a' is preferred above 'b'.

  But how to represent this in code.

  So perhaps, create a dict where each key is an element, and its value is the element it's preferred to.

  But wait, what if two elements are mutually preferred? For example";0.518438720703125;0.2015380859375;0.150054931640625;0.462890625;0.9677734375;0.1900634765625;0.9807142857142858;56.25;9.1;7.77;12.1;8.58;8.8

To determine whether the access to the system is granted, we need to analyze the logical conditions under which the decision is made. The decision rule is as follows:

**Decision Rule:**
Access is granted based on the condition that for each ""support"" of a ""prohibition,"" there must exist a ""corresponding support"" for a ""permission"" where the ""permission's"" support ""dominates"" the ""prohibited"" support. Domination is defined as each element in the permission support being strictly preferred (according to the given preferences) to or at least comparable with one of the prohibitions' elements.

**Outcome:**
The access is **granted** because all conditions for the dominance relation are satisfied across all supports of prohibitions and their corresponding permissions. Specifically, each permission support element is strictly dominated by a corresponding prohibitions support element, ensuring that the conditions for granting access are met.

**Relations andPreferences:**
1. For each support (e.g., support 1, support 2, etc.) of a prohibitions:
   - The permission support elements must be strictly preferred according to the provided preferences.
   - Domination occurs when the permission elements strictly dominate the prohibited elements.

2. The preferences between the elements are analyzed to determine the dominance relations. For example, the preference ""team_leader"" is preferred over ""post_doc,"" and ""secondment"" (as in the context of the context preferences) is generally preferred over default.

3. The specific dominance relations are detailed in the provided example, where each permission and prohibitions element is compared according to these preferences. For instance, the permission element ""secondee"" (from the permission) is strictly more preferred (dominated) over the prohibited element(s) it corresponds to.

4. The overall decision is reached by aggregating these dominance relations across all relevant supports and elements, ensuring consistency and adherence to the defined logic.

By systematically evaluating each element's dominance and the preferences between them, we conclude that the access conditions are satisfied, leading to the granting of access.";0.4884867350260417;0.07674662272135417;0.07674662272135417;0.390869140625;0.97216796875;0.0740966796875;0.9805825242718447;18.15;15.5;13.8;17.3;16.36;16.9

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1381;372;"

### Input Structure:

1. Overall Logic:
   - Access granted if for each prohibition support, there's a corresponding permission support where permission support dominates prohibition support.
   - Dominance: Each element of permission support strictly dominates (is preferred to) corresponding element of prohibition support.

2. Supports of Permission:
   1: The organization大学1 employee Bob performs the 'Staff Member' role for the 'Prohibition' to perform 'validate' on the 'view public_data' if the 'context collaboration' holds.
   2: The university1 employee Olivia performs the role 'Secondee' for the same Prohibition under the same context collaboration condition.

   3: The institute3 employee Bob does the same for Prohibition on 'view WP1' with the same condition.

3. Translated into structured format:

```plaintext
1. Decision Rule:
   Access is denied if for some Prohibition support, no corresponding Permission support dominates it. Specifically, each Prohibition's support must be dominated by a corresponding Permission's support where each element in the permission support is > (prefered to) the corresponding element in prohibited support. If even one Prohibition passes this test, the access is denied.
   
2. Outcome:
   The access was denied due to the violation of the dominance condition for one of the Prohibitions. The specific failure was due to a Prohibition whose support was not entirely dominated by the corresponding Permission supports. For instance, the 'sign' Prohibition could not be fully dominated, leading to the denial of access.
   
3. Relation and Preferences:
   For the failing Prohibition, 'sign':
   - The context 'collaboration' held between Olivia and 'sign', which influenced the dominance check. This context preference was critical in failing to fully dominate the support, thus denying access.

### Structured Output:

1. Relation Between Elements:
   - The relation ""The organisation大学1 employs Zane in the team_leader role"" is preferred over ""The university1 applies Zane to the se_condi role"" because ""team_leader"" is more preferred than ""se_condi"".
   - Similarly, other relations are analyzed to determine the flow of preferences.

2. Decision Process:
   The decision is based on ensuring that for every element in the prohibitions' support, there's a corresponding permission support that dominates it. This is evaluated using the defined logic and preferences.

3. Outcomes:
   Access was granted because all prohibitions were dominated by their respective permissions, meeting the necessary conditions.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

**Step 1: Understanding the Decision Rule**

The decision is governed by the rule that for each restriction (support of a prohibition), there must be a corresponding permissions support where the permissions' support dominates each restriction. This dominance is determined by comparing the preferences and relations between different elements (e.g., role assignments, context preferences, and dominance relations between elements).

**Key Points:**
- For each restriction in prohibitions, find a matching permission support.
- Check if the permission support's elements strictly dominate the restriction's elements.
- Aggregate results across all restrictions to determine overall access.

**Application to the Example:**

- **Prohibition Support:** The prohibitions are analyzed for their respective support elements (roles, contexts, etc.).
- **Permission Support:** Each permission is evaluated to see if its support dominates any restriction.
- **Preferences and Dominance:** Relations between elements are considered, particularly whether one element's support strictly dominates another.

**Conclusion:**

By systematically evaluating each element's preferences and dominance relationships, it is determined that the access conditions are met, leading to the granting of access.";0.67149658203125;0.568115234375;0.568115234375;0.458251953125;0.87158203125;0.10858154296875;0.9742647058823529;12.53;15.6;13.89;17.0;18.5;18.0

Now, let's proceed to the problem.

To solve this problem, I need to analyze the given logic and determine why the access should be granted or not. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, I'll look at the overall logic provided. It states that access is granting if for each ""support"" of a ""prohibition,"" there's a ""corresponding"" ""permission"" support where the ""permission's support"" dominates the ""prohibited's support."" Dominance here means each element in the permission support must be strictly preferred.

Next, I see the supports for the permission and the prohibitions. The supports are lists of elements. For each of these, we need to find a corresponding permission support where each element is strictly dominated.

Then, the preferences between the elements are given. These preferences determine whether one element is preferred over another, which affects whether dominance is possible.

So, my plan is to:

1. Identify all the elements in each support (prohibition and permission).
2. Check if for every element in a prohibitions support, there is a corresponding element in some permission support that dominates it.
   - To do this, I might need to map each prohibitions element to a permission element that strictly dominates it, based on the given preferences.
   However, I also need to make sure that this mapping is possible for all elements in all prohibitions supports.

3. If such a mapping is not possible for any element, then access is denied.

4. If it is possible, then the decision is based on whether all such dominations meet the dominance condition.

5. Finally, the outcome is determined by whether all these conditions are satisfied.

Let me try to apply this to the example given.

In the example input, the supports are as follows:

For the permission (support of permission):
- The support includes elements like ""Eva_Clark is researcher"" and ""sign is validate.""
- The permission support's elements are ""researcher"" (Eva) and ""validate"" (sign).

For the prohibititions support:
- The prohibitions have an element ""sign"" which is validated.

Now, according to the preferences, the relation ""secondment (sign) holds between Eve and sign"" is given. This relation is preferred because secondment (a higher preference) is better than default.

Similarly, in the permutation of the preference, the preference for ""secondee"" being preferred to ""staff"" is also given.

I think the key here is to check if for the prohibited support, each element has a matching permission support element that is dominated by it.

In this case, the prohibited element is ""sign,"" which is part of the permutation. The corresponding permission is ""Eve is researcher."" The relation between these two is secondment, which is given as a higher preference (dominance is defined as each element being strictly preferred).

So, in this example, the dominance holds because the secondment relation is stronger than the default.

Hence, the overall condition is satisfied, and access is allowed.

Wait, but in the example output, the decision was granted. So, in that case, yes, the condition was met.

But in my own analysis, I should make sure I don't make any mistakes.

Another thing to consider is whether all the permutation relations are satisfied for each element. If any element doesn't have a corresponding permutation that satisfies the dominance, the access would be denied.

Also, it's important to note that for each permutation in the prohibitions, there must be a corresponding perm in the permissions that dominates. If even one doesn't satisfy, the entire condition is not met.

Another point to check is whether the mapping from prohibitions to permissions is possible without any conflicts. For example, if one element in prohibitions is mapped to two different permissions, that would cause a conflict and thus the condition would not be met.

Therefore, the steps I should follow are:

- For each element 'e' in each 'prohibition support':
   - Find a 'p' in the 'permission support' such that 'p's permutation dominates 'e'.
   - If for any 'e', no such 'p exists, then overall condition fails.
- If all 'e's have such 'ps', then condition is met, access granted.

Let's apply this logic to the given example.

1. Prohibition support has 'sign' as an element.

2. Permission support has two elements: 'researcher' (Eve) and 'validate' (sign). Wait, no, Eve is researcher, and sign is validate. Wait, the permutation for Eve is 'Eve' (researcher), and for sign is 'validate'. So, Eve's permutation is researcher; sign's is validate.

So for the element 'sign', which is in the prohibits support, we look for a 'permission' element that 'dominates' 'sign'.

Looking at the permissions:

- Eve's support: researcher
- Sign's support (permutation): validate

So, for 'sign,' we need a permutation in permission that dominates 'sign'. Looking at the permutations:

- The permutation of Eve is: researcher (which is strictly more preferred than 'sign'? Or is it the other way around?)

Wait, the problem statement says:

Dominance means: Each element of permission support is *strictly* preferred to *at least one* element of prohibition support.

So in this case:

Eve's permutation: researcher.

Sign: validate.

Is researcher strictly preferred over validate? Or is validate preferred over researcher?

Wait, no. The problem says:

""the relation 'The organisation University1 employee ... preferred to ...' is given, and 'dominance' is when 'each element ... is strictly prefered to ..."".

So, if the relation is 'A preferred to B', then 'A' is dominant over 'B'.

So, looking at the given preference:

The relation ""The Organisation Institute1 employee (university1) employee in role researcher) preferred to (The Organisation University1 ...)' is given.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-examine the example.

In Example Input:

Overall Logic:
Access is granted iff for each prohib, exists perm support where perm support dominates.

Domination condition: each perm support's element is > (strictly preferred) to the prohib's element.

For the example:

Prohibition support: 'sign'.
Permission support: Eve has permutation researcher, sign has permutation validate.

In terms of dominance:

Does researcher (from Eve) dominate validate (from sign)? Or does validate dominate researcher?

We need to determine which is preferred.

Looking back at the example's preference table:

The preference is between the role assignments.

The relation: ""The organisation ... employee preferred to 'the ...'.""

So, 'The Organisation ... employee' (like Eve) prefers to 'The ... ' (like sign).

So in terms of permutation dominance, if Eve's role is preferred (i.e., researcher) over sign's role (validate), then researcher dominates validate.

Thus, for the domination condition, we have that researcher (dominated by Eve's perm) strictly dominates validate (which comes from the sign's perm).

Thus, since researcher > validate, the domination is satisfied.

So the condition holds for this element, and since there are no other prohibitions or permissions to check, the logic holds, so access is grant.

So that's how the example works.

Another example: if there were another prohibitions, say, another element, we'd have to check for that as well.

So to model this, perhaps it's better to represent the permutation dominance as a directed graph, where each edge represents the dominance relation, and then for each prohibited element, see if it has a path in the graph that leads to a permutation that can be dominated by some permission permutation.

But perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model each permutation as a node, and the dominance as an edge from permutation A to permutation B if A dominates B.

But for now, perhaps the approach is:

For each prohibited permutation, check if there exists any permission permutation such that in the dominance hierarchy, the permission permutation dominates the prohibited one.

If for all prohibited permutations, such a permission permutation exists, and for all, the permutations in the domination chain are in a way that each step is a strict dominance, then it's okay.

So putting it all together, the thought process is:

- Break down the logic into decision rules.

- Determine for each step how the logic is applied.

- Check for any potential conflicts or missing permutations.

- Ensure that all required dominance";0.478955078125;0.083740234375;0.083740234375;0.603515625;0.8974609375;0.273681640625;0.9777777777777777;49.21;9.8;7.59;13.5;11.53;10.9

An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision:

### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]

### Output:";1816;349;"

To determine whether the access to the system is granted, we need to analyze the given logic and preferences to see if the conditions for granting access are satisfied.

### Decision Rule
Access is granted **if and only** for every **support of a prohibition**, there **exists** a **corresponding support** of a **permission** where the **permission's support** **dominates** the **prohibition's** support. **Dominance** means that **each element** of the **support** of **the permission** is **strictly preferred** to at **least one element** in the **supports of the prohibition**.

### Outcome
The access is **granted** because the **permission** for **Wendy_Mitchelle** to perform **`cat`** on **`deliverable2`** satisfies the **dominance condition**. Specifically, the **reason** is that the **context audit holds** between **WENDY_MITCHelle**, **CAT**, and **DELIVERABLE2**, which is preferred over the context **default holds**. Additionally, the dominance condition is satisfied because each element in the permission support (which includes `cat` and `deliverable2`) is **preferable** to the corresponding elements (which include `roll2`, `roll3`, and `roll4`) in the prohibitions' support.

### Relations andPreferences
- **Domination Condition**: The permission support includes elements `roll1` (which is ``roll2` in the prohibits' support), and the contextual preferences are satisfied.
- **Contextual Preferences**: The context preferences are also satisfied.

Thus, all conditions are met, leading to the **access being granted**.";0.59598388671875;0.153900146484375;0.153900146484375;0.982421875;0.9873046875;0.297607421875;0.9805825242718447;23.46;15.5;14.29;16.7;16.19;21.1

### Output:";2211;293;"

### Explanation

The decision was made to grant access based on the following structured reasoning:

**1. Decision Rule:**
Access is granted under the condition that for every element of a **prohibition** support, there must exist a corresponding element in a **permission** support where the **permission's support** strictly dominates the **prohibited support**. This dominance is determined by the predefined preference relations between elements.

**2. Outcome:**
The outcome is that access is **granted** for the specific case of **Quinn_Thomas performing a 'sign' on 'report6'**.

**3. Relations and Preferences:**
- **Permission Support Elements:** The **permission support** includes elements such as 'quinn_ Thomas' and 'sign'.
- **Prohibition Support:** The specific **proomination** is 'the organization大学1 grant the role phd_stu the prohibition to perform...' (simplified for understanding).
- **Element Dominance:** For each 'support' in the 'proomination' (e.g., 'sign'), there must be a corresponding 'permission support' where each element is strictly dominated.
- **Preferences:** Preferences dictate that certain elements are preferred over others. For example, 'researcher' is preferred over 'phd_student', and 'management' over 'default'.

By systematically applying these rules and preferences, it was determined that the permission support strictly dominated the prohibiting support, leading to access.";0.6726735432942709;0.2643534342447917;0.1927032470703125;0.97998046875;0.9765625;0.05023193359375;0.9682539682539683;22.11;14.0;13.51;15.6;16.81;17.7

### Output:";1593;387;"

### Structured Output:

**1. Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted based on the condition that for every element of a **prohibition** support, there must exist a corresponding element in a **permission** support where the **permission's support** strictly dominates the **prohibited** support.

**2. Outcome:**  
The outcome of access is **granted** due to the dominance conditions met in the respective supports.

**3. Relations and Preferences:**  
- **Domination Conditions:**  
  - For each element in the permission support, it is strictly dominated by the prohibited support.
  - The domination is determined by the preference relations between the elements.
- **Influencing Preferences:**
  - Preferences are established between elements based on their roles (e.g., team_leader vs. post_doc) and contextual factors (audits vs. collaborations).
  - These preferences guide the assessment of whether a permission support strictly dominates a prohibitions support.

---

**Explanation of Decision Rule:**
Access is allowed only if for every restriction (prohibited support) in the system, there is a corresponding permission support that strictly dominates it. This ensures that the permissions granted are compatible with the prohibitions, maintaining a balance between allowed and disallowed activities.

**Outcome:**
The decision rule led to the granting of access, as all domination conditions were satisfied across the respective support elements, ensuring compliance with the defined logic and preferences.

**Relations andPreferences:**
- The decision was influenced by the establishment of preferences between elements, particularly their roles and the context in which they are used.
- Preferences were established based on pairwise comparisons of elements, such as team_leader being preferred over post_doc.
- Contextual factors, like audits and collaborations, also played a role in determining the dominance of one support over another.
- These factors ensured that the logic was applied consistently across all elements, leading to the final decision of granting access.";0.5019073486328125;0.14849853515625;0.1067657470703125;0.404541015625;0.99072265625;0.1409912109375;0.9759450171821306;18.76;15.3;13.46;16.5;17.17;17.8

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1383;213;"

To determine the access granted, we analyze the conditions under which the decision is made. The decision rule is based on whether the permission support meets the criteria set by the prohibitions.

### Decision Rule:
For each support (prohibition) of the system, there must exist a corresponding permission support where the permutation's support strictly dominates the prohibition's support.

### Outcome:
The access is denied because the permutation support does not meet the dominance criteria for all prohibitions. Specifically, one of the permutation supports does not strictly dominate its corresponding prohibitions, leading to the denial of access.

### Relations andPreferences:
- **Permutation Support Domination**: For each permutation support, we check if it strictly dominates any corresponding permutation support of prohibitions.
- **Domination Conditions**: One permutation support fails to strictly dominate a prohibitions support, causing the access to be denied.

### Conclusion:
The denial of accessing the system is due to the failure to meet the strict dominance condition for all permutation supports relative to prohibitions' supports. This results in the access being denied.";0.4571044921875;0.10174560546875;0.10174560546875;0.1405029296875;0.96875;0.0272216796875;0.9883720930232558;18.96;15.2;13.38;16.2;16.88;16.9

### Output:";1386;377;"

### Solution

The decision process for granting access is based on the following structured reasoning:

**1. Decision Rule:**
Access is granted under the condition that for each ""support"" of a ""prohibition"" (i.e., each role or activity that restricts certain permissions), there must exist a ""corresponding support"" from a ""permission"" where the ""permission's support"" strictly dominates the ""permission's support."" This dominance is defined as each element in the permission support being strictly preferred (in terms of hierarchy or role precedence) to or at least comparable with the corresponding elements within the prohibitions' support.

**2. Outcome:**
The access is **granted** because all the ""supports of prohibitions"" are dominated by the ""supports of permissions"" according to the defined dominance rule. Specifically, for the given prohibitions and permissions, the dominance conditions are satisfied across all relevant elements, ensuring that the overall access criteria are met.

**3.Relations And Preferences:**
- **Domination of Support Elements:** For each element within the ""prohibitions"" support, there is a corresponding element in ""permissions"" support that strictly dominates it. This is determined by the hierarchy of roles and preferences established in the overall logic.
- **Context and Collaboration Preferences:** The context and collaboration preferences influence whether prohibitions are met. In this case, the context preferences are satisfied, leading to the granting of access.
  
By systematically applying the dominance rule and considering all relevant preferences, the decision process confirms that access is allowed.

**Final Answer:**

The decision was made to grant access because all support elements for prohibitions were strictly dominated by corresponding support elements in permissions, satisfying the dominance condition. The context preferences were also satisfied, allowing access to be granted.

**Answer:** The decision was granted due to strict dominance of support elements and satisfied context preferences.";0.459857177734375;0.10992431640625;0.10992431640625;0.10577392578125;0.9853515625;0.011688232421875;0.993006993006993;17.13;15.9;13.73;17.4;17.0;18.2

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";3138;189;"

### Output

**Decision Rule:**
Access is granted based on the condition that for every supporting permutation of a prohibitive role, there must exist a corresponding supporting permutation in a permissible permission that strictly dominates the prohibitive permutation.

**Outcome:**
The access is denied because the condition for dominance is not met for all supporting permutations of prohibitive roles.

** Relations and Preferences:**
1. For the supporting permutation ""The organisation U3 employs KMo in role coordinator"" (preferring KMo over KMo at U3), the corresponding permission ""The permission for KMo to perform an activity validate is granted"" (where KMo is strictly dominated by KMo) satisfies the condition.
2. For other supporting permutations, the conditions for dominance are not met, leading to the denial of access.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the logical evaluation, access was denied due to failure to meet the dominance condition for all relevant supporting permutations.";0.4861188252766927;0.238739013671875;0.18739954630533853;0.13818359375;0.9560546875;0.08978271484375;0.9513888888888888;13.58;17.3;16.8;19.1;15.79;18.4

Your task is to explain the logic behind the example given in the problem. For the purpose of this question, you must use the provided input to construct the output. 

In the example input, the overall logic explains the condition for access granting. The decision rule in the example is given as: ""Access is granted..."". The outcome is described as ""The permission for... is granted."" The relations include things like ""The relation 'R'..."" and ""R is preferred over S.""

So, for the problem, I need to create an explanation of the decision process for the given input. I should structure the response according to the provided format and include all the necessary details from the input.

Now, let's think about how to break down the problem.

First, the input has three sections:

1. Overall Logic: This explains under what conditions access is allowed. It mentions that for each prohibition support, there must be a corresponding permission support where each permission support element strictly dominates the corresponding prohibition support element.

2. Supports of Permission: This lists the elements (supports) of the permissions. Each support is a list of elements. For example, support 1 of permission includes elements like ""the organization... employee in role..."".

3. Supports Of Prohibition: Similar to the above, but for the prohibitions.

4. Preferences Between Elements: A list of relations where each relation is of the form ""element A prefers element B"" or ""element B is preferred by element A."" These relations are used to determine dominance.

The decision rule is the rule that determines access. In the example, it's something like ""access is granted when for every prohibition support P, there's a permission support Q where Q's support strictly dominates P's support.""

The outcome is the specific conclusion reached, such as ""the permission for ... is granted.""

In the Relations And Preferences section, we need to list all the relations and how they contribute to the decision.

So, to model this, I'll need to extract:

- All the support elements for permissions and prohibitions.
- For each support element in a permission, determine whether it strictly dominates any element in the corresponding prohibitions support.
- Use the given relations to determine the dominance.

I think the steps to solve this are as follows:

Step 1: Extract all support elements from the permissions and prohibits.

Step 2: For each permutation of these support elements, check if each permission element can dominate a prohibitions element.

Wait, no. The condition is for each P in prohibitions, find a Q in permissions such that Q's supports strictly dominate P's supports.

So for every P support, find Q support that strictly dominates.

If for all P, such Q exists, then access granted.

So the process is:

For each P support:

   For each Q support:

      Check if each element in Q supports is strictly dominated by the corresponding element in P support.

      If all elements in Q support strictly dominate the corresponding P support's elements, then success.

But how do we model the strict dominance?

The relations are given as ""A prefers B,"" meaning A is better than B.

We can model this as a directed graph where an edge from A to B indicates A is preferred.

Then, to check dominance, we can perform a topological sort and see if for each position, the relation holds.

Alternatively, since all relations are known, perhaps we can precompute for each element pair whether A strictly dominates B.

But perhaps it's more efficient to model the dominance as a graph and then perform a reachability check.

But for the sake of this problem, perhaps the approach is to:

- Create a dictionary where each element is mapped to its preferred element.

- Then, for any two elements A and B, determine if A is strictly dominant over B by checking if in the dictionary, if A's preferred element is equal to B, then A does not strictly dominate B. Otherwise, if the preferred element of A is greater than B (based on some ordering), then dominance holds.

But wait, the dominance is not necessarily a total order, so we need a way to represent strict dominance.

Hmm, perhaps an alternative approach is needed.

Let me think about the example.

In the given example, the decision is based on whether the permission support (e.g., ""Chloe_Walker can perform drop"") is dominated by a prohibition support (something like ""constraint on drop"").

In the relations, we have:

- The relation ""the relation 'chloe_walker' prefers 'drop'"" is given.

Also, in the preferences, ""drop is preferred between Chloe-Walker, secondment, and default.""

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me look back at the example's preferences.

The example's relations are:

The relation ""R"" is ""chloe-walker"" prefers ""drop.""

Another relation is ""R2"" which is ""context audit holds"" preferred to ""context collaboration holds.""

But perhaps the key is to model for each pair of elements whether one strictly dominates another.

But given that the relations are in the form of A prefers B, which can be used to infer dominance.

For example, if ""A is preferred"" to ""B,"" then A is considered strictly dominant of B.

Thus, for two elements X and Y, X strictly dominates Y if in all relations, whenever X is preferred, Y is not preferred, and vice versa. Wait, no, that's not necessarily the case.

Wait no, the 'preferred' relation is a partial order, not necessarily transitive. So, for example, A could be preferred over B, and B preferred over C, but A and C may not have a direct relation.

But in our case, for strict dominance, for X to strictly dominate Y, every relation must state that X is more preferred than Y, and no relation exists that states Y is preferred more than X.

So to determine if X is strictly dominating Y, for all relations R, if R says X prefers Y, then Y does not prefer X. Because if Y prefers X, that would mean X is not strictly dominant.

So in our example, for a pair X, Y, if for every relation R, either R doesn't say X prefers to Y, or R says Y prefers to X, then we can conclude that X strictly dominant Y.

But if for some R, X prefers and Y doesn't prefer, and for some other R, Y prefers and X doesn't, then it's a cycle, and thus no strict dominance can be established.

So perhaps the first step is to process all relations and build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each edge represents the preference of one element over another.

Once we have this DAG, for pairs of elements (X, Y), we can check whether X is reachable from Y in the DAG. If so, then in the context of the DAG, X is a strict superset of Y, meaning that X's elements are all strictly preferred over Y's elements.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe it's better to think in terms of dominance per element.

For each element X in a support of permission, check whether there exists an element Y in any support of prohibitions such that for every element in Y, Y's element is strictly less than X's element.

But this seems computationally intensive, but perhaps manageable given the small size of the problem (since the input is manageable).

Let me try to outline the steps for the solution.

1. Extract all elements from all supports of permissions and prohibitions.

   For permissions:

   - Collect all elements that appear in any of the P support lists.

   Similarly for prohibitions: collect all elements appearing in any P support list.

   Wait, but each support list for P may have different elements.

   So for P supports, collect all unique elements across all P supports.

   Same for Prohibitions.

   Then, each support in P and Prohibits is a set of elements.

So:

P_supports = list of sets, each set is the elements of a support for permission.

P_prohibits = set of all elements (across all P_supports).

Similarly, for Probit_supports (supports of prohibits).

2. For each P_support in P_probits:

   We need to find a P_probit_support (from Probit support list) such that each of its elements is strictly more dominant than the corresponding elements of P_support.

   But how?

   Let's think: For a given P_support (like [A1, A2, A3]), and a ProbitSupport (B1, B2, B3), we need for each i, A_i > B_i, where >";0.6013346354166667;0.6707763671875;0.4042561848958333;0.26025390625;0.8818359375;0.21044921875;0.9872340425531915;55.24;9.5;8.38;12.8;9.22;9.6

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Structured Output:

**Decision Rule:**
Access is granted based on the condition that for each supporting prohibition, a corresponding supporting permission must have a support that strictly dominates the prohibitions' support.

**Outcome:**
The access was successfully granted due to the dominance condition between the permission support and prohibitions support, ensuring that all prohibitions were strictly dominated by the corresponding permissions.

**Relations andPreferences:**
- The permission support (Nathan_White performing list) was dominated by prohibitions (list), satisfying the condition.
- All relevant preference relations were considered, confirming the dominance and granting access.

---

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

**1. Overall Logic:**
For access to be granted, it is necessary that for every supporting role (prohibition) in a given organization, there must exist a corresponding role (permission) in the same organization. This role must strictly dominate the supporting role of the prohibited activity.

**2. Decision Process:**
We evaluated each supporting permission and prohibited activity. For each prohibited activity, we checked if there was a corresponding permission whose support strictly dominated the prohibited support. This was determined by analyzing the preferences and dominance relations between different elements.

**3. Outcomes:**
All supporting permissions were found to strictly dominate their respective prohibitions. This satisfied the condition for granting access, leading to the successful granting of access.

**4. Reasoning:**
Each supporting permission was examined to ensure it strictly dominated its prohibited counterpart. The preferences between elements were analyzed, confirming that the dominance conditions were met. This comprehensive evaluation led to the conclusion that access was appropriately granted.

**5. Conclusion:**
Since all supporting permissions strictly dominated their prohibitions, access to the organization was granted. This decision was based on thorough evaluation of dominance conditions and preference relations.";0.5791248321533203;0.060291290283203125;0.05591392517089844;0.9365234375;0.98779296875;0.1448974609375;0.9891304347826086;12.94;15.4;13.16;17.2;19.25;18.1

### Output:";1372;267;"

### Structured Answer

1. ### Decision Rule
The access to the system is determined by the following rule: ""For each restriction (support of a prohibiting role), there must exist a corresponding role support in a permission such that every element of this permission support is stochastically strictly dominated by the corresponding elements of this restriction.""

2. ### Outcome
Access is denied due to the failure to meet the dominance conditions across all restrictions. Specifically, the prohibitive restrictions did not have corresponding permission supports that strictly dominated them, resulting in access denial.

3 ### Relations andPreferences
The decision was influenced by a detailed analysis of element preferences:
- **Domination Conditions**: For each prohibitive restriction, there was no corresponding permission role support that uniformly and strictly dominated it.
- **Element Preferences**:
  - **Role Preferences**: Some roles were preferred over prohibitive roles based on context and hierarchy.
  - These preferences influenced whether a permission could strictly dominate a restriction.

The failure of these conditions collectively led to access being denied.

### Final Answer

The decision rule was applied to each restriction, checking for the existence of matching permission supports. However, due to failure in meeting dominance conditions, access was **denied**. The analysis revealed failures in element preferences, particularly in role and context preferences, which contributed to the denial.";0.418072509765625;0.08209228515625;0.08209228515625;0.10211181640625;0.84326171875;0.019195556640625;0.9906976744186047;18.65;15.3;13.31;17.2;17.58;17.7

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1383;319;"

### Structured Explanation:

**1. Decision Rule:**
Access is granted based on the rule that for each ""support"" of a ""prohibition,"" there must exist a ""corresponding support"" of ""a permission"" where the ""permission's support"" strictly dominates the ""prohibited's support."" Dominance is defined as each element in the permission support being strictly preferred.

**2. Outcome:**
The access was successfully granted because all ""supports"" of prohibitions were dominated by their respective ""permissions's supports."" Specifically, the ""permutation"" support elements were strictly preferred over the prohibitions' support elements, ensuring compliance with the defined dominance condition.

**3.relations and Preferences:**
- **Permutation Support 1 (Organization University1):** The role ""researcher"" was preferred over ""full_professor"" due to ""context management holds.""
  - ""Context management holds"" between ""Wendy_Mitch Mitchell,"" ""sign,"" and ""report2"" in the University1 context.
  - This context preference led to the dominance of the permutation support over the prohibited support.
  
- ** permutation Support 2 (Institute1):**
  - The ""role researcher"" was again preferred over other permutation roles, contributing to the overall dominance of permutation supports over prohibitions.

- ** permutations Support 3 (Institue3):** Similar to permutation support 1, context management held, leading to the permutation's support dominating the prohibited's support.

**Conclusion:**
All permutation supports were strictly dominated by prohibitions, granting access.";0.4638671875;0.04052734375;0.04052734375;0.85107421875;0.958984375;0.57177734375;0.9801980198019802;11.41;16.0;15.08;16.4;19.6;20.3

### Output:";1596;355;"

To determine whether the access should be granted, we need to analyze the conditions under which the decision is made. The decision is based on the following steps:

1. For each **support** of a **prohibition**, we must find a corresponding **permission** whose support **dominates** the **prohibited** support.
2. The **domination** condition requires that every element in the **permission's support** is **strictly preferred** to or at least matches the elements in **the prohibited support**.
3. We also need to consider the **preferences** between the elements to determine if the permission can be granted.

### Decision Rule
Access is **granted** if for every **support of a prohibit** (i.e., the prohibited activity), there exists at least a **corresponding permission** whose **support dominates** the prohibited **support**, considering the given preferences.

### Outcome
The access will **be granted** because all the conditions for dominance have been satisfied. Specifically, the permission support elements (e.g., ""Chloe_Walker performs edit"") strictly dominate the prohibitions' support elements, ensuring that the required conditions are met.

### Relations andPreferences
- **Domination Conditions**:
  - **Permission Support Dominates Prohibition Support**:
    - The permission support includes elements that strictly prefer or match those in the prohibited support.
    - For example, if the prohibitory support includes ""edit"" and ""report3,"" the permission must include elements that dominate each of these.
  - This ensures that each prohibited element is strictly dominated by the permission elements, meeting the dominance condition.

### Conclusion
By satisfying the dominance conditions across all prohibitory supports, we conclude that access is **grantable**.";0.5659271240234375;0.05872344970703125;0.05872344970703125;0.81103515625;0.95556640625;0.054412841796875;0.9798387096774194;28.74;13.5;12.53;16.3;16.06;17.2

### Output:";1194;241;"

To determine whether access to a system is granted, we follow a structured reasoning process based on given logic, support details, and preference rules.

### Decision Rule
Access is denied if for any permutation of prohibitive supports, no corresponding permutation of permission supports strictly dominate them.

### Outcome
The decision was made to allow access, as all conditions for strict dominance were satisfied.

### Relations and Preferred Preferences
1. Relation: The preference ""The Organisation University 1 employs... "" is more preferred than the ""Organisation consortium employs..."" due to the dominance relationship between roles.
2. Relation #: Secondment preferences are considered more important than default contexts.
3. Other Relations: No role preferences are needed as roles are identical.

### Dominance Conditions
For each support permutation:
- The permission support elements (roles, permissions, contexts) are strictly dominated by the respective prohibitive elements.

### Conclusion
All dominance conditions met, leading to access granted.

### Final Answer
The reasoning process applied to the given logic and support details resulted in granting access due to satisfying all strict dominance conditions, as outlined in the structured explanation.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

To get started, I need to understand the problem. The problem is about determining whether access to a certain system is granted based on some logic involving permissions and prohibitions. The logic has an overall structure with different elements, some of which are supports of permissions, others of prohibitions, and some preferences between these elements.

The task is to explain how the decision was made, using the provided input, which includes the structure of the logic, the supports (supports of permissions), the prohibitions (supports), and the preferences between elements. The input is given in a structured way, with sections for the overall logic and then for each element (support of permission, support of prohibition, and their preferences).

I need to break down the problem step by step, identify the key points, and explain the reasoning process in a clear and concise manner. I should make sure to cover all relevant parts of the input and explain how each part contributes to the decision.

Let me start by looking at the input provided.

The input is divided into two main sections:

1. Overall Logic: This explains the condition for access being granted. It mentions that access is given if for each prohibition support, there's a corresponding permission support where each permission support element is strictly dominated by the corresponding prohibition support element.

2. Supports of Permission: This lists the supports for permissions. Each support is a list of elements. For example, the first support of permission is a set of elements like ""org east_hhospital grants doctor the permission to perform..."".

Similarly, in the input, there are multiple supports for prohibitions.

Then, the input provides preferences between the elements. These preferences are the reasons why one element is preferred over another.

The goal is to use this structured input to explain why the access decision was granted. So, I'll need to go through each part and see how the logic leads to the conclusion.

First, let's look at the Decision Rule section. The decision rule in the example is given as: ""Access is granted ..."". The rule is explained in more detail in the Relation and Preferences section.

In the example, it's stated that the permission support (Zane's permission to read db on pt med data) is granted due to the dominance condition. The reasoning is broken down into each relation and preference.

So, in our case, we need to apply similar reasoning but using the specific details from the input.

I think the best approach is to outline each step of the decision process as per the input's structure.

Step 1: Identify all the supports of each permission and each prohibition.

Looking at the Overall Logic section, for the example input, we have:

- Support of Permission:
  - (support1): Organized east hospital grants doctor as a permission.
  - Similarly for other supports of permission.

Wait, no, the example's input is different. Let me re-examine the problem.

The problem says that the input is structured with two sections: Overall Logic and the details of each element.

But in the problem statement, the user provided an example input and output. The example input seems to be a specific case, but the problem itself is about explaining the logic.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to refer to the problem's structure as given in the user's question.

In any case, I think I should structure my explanation based on the given input.

Looking back, the problem says:

The input has two sections. The first is ""Overall Logic"", explaining the condition, and the second is the details, which include:

- 2nd section: Supports of permissions.

- 3rd section: Prohibitions.

- The 4th section: Preferences between elements.

Thus, I can structure my answer to follow these sections.

But wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should think of the problem as having:

- A set of permissions (each has a support, which is a collection of elements).

- A single prohibition (its support is also a collection).

- For each element in the forbidden support, we must find a corresponding element in a permission support that dominates it.

Dominance is defined as each element being strictly preferred over the corresponding one in the prohibition's support.

The decision rule is given, but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, I should explain it in detail.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is similar to the example given, so I can use that as a template.

The example's overall logic explains that for access to be granted, each prohibition must have a supporting permission where each of its support elements dominates the corresponding prohibitions' support elements. Domination is strict preference, so each element must be strictly better than the corresponding element.

In their example, they have different supports for permission and prohibiting, and certain preferences between their elements.

In our problem, the decision is based on whether, for all prohibitions in the support, each of their support elements is dominated by some support element of a permissible.

So the steps for the reasoning would be:

1) For each support (prohibition) in the logic:

   a) Check if the support is non-empty. If it's empty, maybe it doesn't contribute.

   b) For this support, check if there's any corresponding permissible support.

   c) If there's no permissible support, then perhaps the access is denied.

   d) If a permissible support exists, then check if for every element in this permissible support's support:

      i) There exists a permission element that strictly dominates it according to the preferences.

      ii) If such a dominator exists, proceed.

      iii) If not, then the access might be denied.

2) If for every prohibited support, a corresponding dominator permissible exists, and for all elements in those dominators, the dominance conditions are met, then access is allowed.

3) If any of the above conditions are not met (e.g., a prohibited support has no dominator, or a prohibited element is not dominated by any dominator), then access may or may not be denied, but in our problem's context, perhaps access is only granted if all conditions are satisfied.

But perhaps in the given problem, we can assume that all elements are covered, and we just need to determine whether for each prohibited element, the dominator is found, and whether the dominators are compatible across all prohibited elements.

Given that, let me try to outline the steps.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

The overall logic is structured as follows:

Overall Logic: The condition for accessing the system is that for each restriction (prohibited support), there must be a corresponding positive support (permission support) where each element strictly dominates the prohibited support's elements. This is formalized as:

Access granted iff for every p in prohibitions:

   ∃ s_p in permissions such that s_p.dominates(p)

Where s_p is a support for permission, and p is the support for the prohibition.

Domination is defined such that for any element x in s_p, there must exist an element y in p such that y is strictly more preferred than x.

Now, given the specific input, the steps to determine access are as follows.

1. For each of the provided supports of prohibited (prohibitions):

   a. Examine the support (set of elements) of the prohibited. If this set is empty, skip (no need to check).

   b. For the current prohibited support (p):

      i. Check if there is a corresponding supported permission (s_p).

      ii. If no s_p exists for p, access may be denied. But in our example, if all s_p are found, then we proceed.

   iii. If there is an s_p for p:

      iv. For every element e in the s_p:

          - Check if e can be dominated by an element f in p.

          - Dominance is strict: f must be preferred over e.

      v. If for all e in p, such an f exists in p that dominates e, then proceed. Otherwise, deny access.

      vi. If any element in p cannot be dominated, access denied.

      But perhaps, for simplicity, the logic is such that if for all p, there is s_p that dominates p's elements, access granted. Else, denied.

But to avoid getting too bogged down, perhaps we can structure the explanation as:

For each prohibited support:

   - Find the corresponding permission supports.

   - For each such permission, check that all its elements are strictly dominated.

   If all prohibited supports have such dominators in their corresponding permissible supports, then grant access.

Else, deny.

So applying this to our problem.

Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Explanation

The decision to grant access was made based on a structured logical inference process. The decision rule applied was that for each supporting permutation of prohibitions, there must exist a corresponding permutation of permissions where the permissions' supports dominate the prohibitions' supports. This rule ensures that permissions are granted only when they provide a higher level of dominance over prohibitions.

In this case, the reasoning process was as follows:

1. For each permutation of support of prohibited activities (prohibition support), we examined the corresponding permutations of permissions (permission support) to determine if the permission support could dominate the prohibiting support.

2. The logic was applied to all relevant permutations of both prohibitions and permissions, considering the dominance conditions and the preferences established in the overall logic.

3. The relations between different elements, such as preferences and contexts, were analyzed to understand how each element contributes to the dominance of permissions over prohibations.

4. By systematically evaluating each permutation and applying the dominance rule, it was determined that the permission to perform a specific action (e.g., ""perform ask"") was granted, as it satisfied the dominance condition across all relevant supporting permutations.

Thus, the granting of access was based on the logical consistency and dominance conditions applied to the permutations of permission and prohibiting supports, ensuring that the decision was made in accordance with the defined rules and context preferences.";0.4662263488769531;0.053859710693359375;0.05083160400390625;0.321533203125;0.98876953125;0.0838623046875;0.991304347826087;14.39;16.9;16.85;19.0;17.29;18.7

### Output:";1886;445;"

The decision rule is based on the condition that access is denied if any supporting condition is not met, and granted if all supporting conditions are met.

The outcome is that the access has been granted due to the logical consistency of the supporting conditions across all prohibitions and their respective permissions.

The relations and Preferences are detailed as follows:

1. The relation ""The organisation e.x. employes ..."" is preferred over other relations because it aligns with the hierarchy of roles and contexts.

2. Each relation is compared to determine if it contributes to the granting of access.

3. Each preference is considered to ensure that permissions dominate over prohibitions.

4. All supporting conditions for prohibitions are satisfied, leading to access.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. For each support (prohibition) of the system:
   - For each corresponding support (permission) of a prohibition:
     - Check if the permission support (support of permission) dominates the prohibition's support.
     - Domination is determined by whether each element in the permission’s support strictly prefers to an element in prohibitions’ support.
   - If a domination condition is satisfied for all supports of prohibitions, access proceeds. If any domination condition fails, access does not proceed.
2. If all domination conditions are satisfied across all supports, the system grants access.
3. The decision rule can be formalized as: ""For access to be granted, every supporting condition (for every prohibiting support) must be met (i.e., for every permission support, there must exist a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohibiting support).""
4. The domination relation is defined as: For any two supports, A and B, A dominates B if for every element in B, there is a corresponding element in A that strictly prefers A over B.
5. Preferences are used to prioritize certain relations over others, ensuring that the most favorable conditions are considered first.
6. In the given example, the domination conditions were met for each supporting condition of each prohibiting support, resulting in access being granted.

**Conclusion:**
The system granted access due to satisfying all necessary domination conditions across the prohibitions' supports, ensuring logical consistency and adherence to the defined decision rule.";0.43224080403645837;0.0680694580078125;0.06322733561197917;0.217041015625;0.97509765625;0.1622314453125;0.9858757062146892;28.33;13.7;11.93;15.9;14.09;14.2

        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1947;300;"

To determine whether the access to the system is granted, we need to analyze the given logic and input. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Overall Logic
The overall logic states that access is grantable if for each **support** of a **prohibition**, there **exists** a **corresponding support** for a **permission** where the **permission's** support **dominates** the **prohibited** support. **Dominance** means that **each element** of the **permission's support** is **strictly preferred** to **at least one** element in the **support of the prohibitions**.

Additionally, there are specific **relations and preferences** that influence the decision:
- Specialization is preferred over other roles.
- Context preferences are considered, with certain contexts being preferred over others.
- Dominance is the key factor in determining whether a permission is granted.
- Domination is also influenced by context preferences, where certain contexts are deemed more important than others.

The **resulting decision** is based on whether all prohibitions have their corresponding permissions that meet the dominance criteria, considering the context and specialization preferences.

### Final Answer
The access is **granted** because for each of Bob's permissions, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohibited support, taking into account the dominance and context preferences. Specifically, Bob's permission to perform edits is granted due to the dominance condition being satisfied.";0.42798309326171874;0.07224273681640625;0.0715179443359375;0.199462890625;0.90869140625;0.11199951171875;0.995433789954338;26.4;14.4;13.58;15.8;15.95;17.6

### Output:";3095;285;"

### Explanation

The decision was made based on a structured logical inference process. The decision rule applied was that for each supporting permutation of prohibitions, there must exist a corresponding permutation of permissions where the permissions' supports dominate the prohibitions' supports. This rule was applied across all relevant elements.

### Relations and Preferences

1. For each permutation of support in prohibitions:
   - The relation ""The relation `X` is preferred over `Y`"" was considered. This relation was based on the preference hierarchy provided in the input.
2. The context of emergency, sample analysis, and no anesthesia were all considered in determining the preferred relations.
3. The following relations were found to be preferred over others in the context of the problem:
   * The preference for ""context emergency holds"" over ""context sample analysis holds"" was given precedence.
   * Similarly, the relation for ""anesthesic patient holds"" preferred over ""sample analysis holds"".
   * Additionally, the preference for permutations of ""liberal_doctor"" and ""anesthetic patient"" over other permutations was considered.
4. The permutations of permissions and prohibitions were analyzed to determine if their supports dominated each other.

### Conclusion

Applying these relations and considering the context preferences, it was determined that the permission to perform on `sample_1` was granted.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1939;401;"

To determine whether access to the system is granted, we need to analyze the given logic, support lists, and preference relations. The decision rule is based on the condition that for each ""support"" of a ""prohibition,"" there must exist a ""corresponding support"" for a ""permission"" where the ""permission's support"" strictly dominates the ""prohibited's support."" Dominance is defined as each element in the permission support being strictly preferred (according to the given preferences) to the corresponding element in prohibitions support.

### Structured Explanation:

1. ### Decision Rule:
   The decision is made by evaluating whether, for all prohibitions, there is a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohibitions' support. This requires checking each permission support against each prohibition support and ensuring that the dominance condition is met for all cases.

2. ### Outcome:
   Access is **granted** because all conditions of the dominance rule are satisfied across all relevant permission and prohibitions supports.

3. ### Relations andPreferences:
   - **Domination Check**:
     - **Permission Support Elements**:
       - **Support 1 (Mia_Anderson)**:
         - **Element 1**: The permission support ""Mia""Anderson"" is strictly dominated by the prohibions' support ""Prohibition"" (i.e., Mia""Anderson > Prohibition).
         - This is because, according to the preference relations, the preference chain is ""Hospital_doctor"" > ""Patient"" (as ""MIA"" is preferred over ""PROHIBITION"" in the context of the north-hospital organization).
       - The other elements (e.g., ""Transfer"" and ""Matet_Pedigree"") are also strictly dominated in a similar fashion.
     - The domination is further confirmed by the specific preference chains given in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Since all permission supports strictly dominate their respective prohibitions under the provided preference relations and dominance conditions, the access is successfully granted.";0.6132527669270833;0.2683614095052083;0.2683614095052083;0.716796875;0.98046875;0.167724609375;0.9628252788104089;17.74;15.7;14.27;17.3;17.75;19.2

        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Structured Explanation

**1. Decision Rule:**
Access is granted based on the condition that for every supporting role of a prohibitive support, there must exist a corresponding supporting role under a permission that strictly dominates the prohibitive role.

**2. Outcome:**
The permission for **Rachel_Baker** to perform **delegate** on **prescription_1** is **granted**.

**3. Relations and Preferences:**
- **Permissible Roles and Domination:**
  - **Permission Support:** Includes **role doctor**, **role patient**, and **role nurse**. Each role must be strictly dominated by a corresponding role in a permission.
- **Prohibitions and Contexts:**
   - **Prohibited Roles:** Include **role staff_member** and **context emergency**, **context sample_analysis**, etc. Each prohibited role must have a corresponding permission role that dominates it.
- Specific Preferences:
  - Dominance of roles such as doctor being preferred over patient.
  - Context preferences, e.g., emergency preferred over sample_analysis, and vice versa.
- Detailed Reasoning Process:
   - For each prohibited role, identify the corresponding permission roles.
   - Check if each permission role is strictly dominant over the prohibited role using the provided preference relations.
   This process ensures that all prohibitive roles are dominated by appropriate permissions, leading to the grant of access.";0.5670396592881944;0.179718017578125;0.1554802788628472;0.96923828125;0.97119140625;0.4404296875;0.983957219251337;23.93;13.3;11.99;14.6;17.22;16.9

### Output:";3261;358;"

### Input Analysis

The input provides the overall logic for determining access, the supports of permissions and prohibitions, and the preferences between elements. The task is to analyze this logic and determine whether access is approved or denied.

### Decision Rule

The decision rule is based on the condition that for each supporting role of a prohibition, there must exist a corresponding supporting role in a permission that dominates the prohibition's role. Domination is defined as each element in the permission support being strictly preferred over the prohibitions' support.

### Outcome

The outcome is that access is denied because the condition for dominance is not met.

### Relations and Preferences

The analysis shows that for some roles, the permission does not have a supporting role that strictly dominates the corresponding prohibitions. This is due to the specific preferences and relations between different elements.

### Structured Explanation

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the reasoning process:

1. The decision rule requires that for every supporting role (support) of a prohibiting role (prohibition), there must be a corresponding role from a permission (permission support) that dominates this prohibiting role.

2. The analysis identifies cases where this condition is not satisfied. For example, in some cases, the supporting roles of permissions do not strictly dominate the prohibiting roles.

3. The relations between elements are considered, and specific preferences are applied. These are used to determine whether the dominance condition is met.

4. Based on the analysis, it is determined that the access is not granted.

### Final Answer

The access is **denied** because the conditions for dominance are not met. Specifically, for some prohibiting roles, there is no corresponding permission support that dominates their role. This conclusion is drawn from the structured analysis of the decision rules and preferences provided in the input.";0.37479807535807297;0.06180572509765625;0.060292561848958336;0.1041259765625;0.7509765625;0.10321044921875;0.9966666666666667;37.0;12.4;11.95;15.8;14.32;14.2

        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Input:1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if,         for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.         Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization north_hospital grants the role hospital_doctor the Permission to perform the activity analyze on the view admin_data if the context referent_doctor holds,The organisation north_hospital employes Dylan_Nelson in the role hospital_doctor, The organisation central_hospital considers biopsy as a analyze activity, The organisation north_hospital uses patinet_medical_data_5 in the view admin_data, The context referent_doctor holds between Dylan_Nelson, biopsy, and patinet_medical_data_5 in the organisation north_hospital,

4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation north_hospital employes Dylan_Nelson in the role hospital_doctor, `` is preferred to ``The organisation east_hospital employes Dylan_Nelson in the role student, `` because: hospital_doctor is preferred to student. 
The relation ``The context referent_doctor holds between Dylan_Nelson, biopsy, and patinet_medical_data_5 in the organisation north_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context sample_analysis holds between Dylan_Nelson, biopsy, and patinet_medical_data_5 in the organisation east_hospital, `` because: referent_doctor is preferred to sample_analysis.

```

Now, let's try to figure out how to approach this problem.

First, I need to understand the problem. The task is to model the given logic, input, and output into a structured explanation. The example given in the problem helps in understanding how the decision is made.

Let me look at the example input and output.

In the example, the overall logic explains the condition for access being granted. It mentions that for each prohibition support, there's a corresponding permission support where the permutation of dominance is maintained.

The decision rule in the example is given as: ""Access is granted ..."". The outcome is described as ""The permission ... is granted."" The relations are broken down into preferences between different elements.

So, for the given problem, I'll need to:

1. Break down the input into its components.
2. Analyze each part to determine how the logic applies.
3. Formulate the decision rules and outcomes based on the analysis.

Let's proceed step by step.

**Step 1: Break Down the Input**

The input is structured as follows:

- **1. Overall Logic:** This is a description of the conditions for granting access. It explains the rule in terms of conditions and relations.
- **2. Supports of Permission (Sop):** A list of elements that make up the support for the permission. Each element is a role assignment or another support (like biopsy).
- **3. Sop for Prohibition (Spb):** Similar to Sop but for the support (prohibition) side. It's the elements on which the prohibit action is applied.
- Additionally, **4. Preferences Between Elements:** These are the relations between elements, indicating which are preferred over others.

The overall logic is given in a structured way, explaining the condition using terms like 'support' and 'dominance'. The Sop and Spb are lists of elements, and the preferences are relations between these elements, specifying which relations are preferred (like 'hospital_doctor' is preferred over 'student' because 'doctor' comes before 'student').

The example input is a bit complex, but I can parse it into these components.

**Example Input Analysis:**

- Overall Logic:
  - Access granted if for each Sop of a Spb, exists a Spop (permission support) where Sop dominates Spb.
  - Dominance: Each element of Sop is strictly dominated by an element of Spop.

- Sop (Permission Support):
  - (support1): Organization North-Hospital grants role Hospital-doctor the permission to perform analyze on view admin data if context refers to doctor. So, the support is about analyzing on admin data, mediated by context referring to doctor (a role assignment).
  - Similarly, other supports in the Sop list.

- Spb (Prohibition Support): 
  - The same as Sop, but the elements are the roles or contexts that prohibit the action. For example, support1 in Spb is about the analyze action.

- Preferences:
  For each element in Spop, it's compared to Spop elements, etc., to see which relations hold.

**Parsing the Example Input:**

Let me try to parse each part.

**Overall Logic:**

The condition is met if for every Sop in the Spb list, there is a corresponding Spop in Sop such that Sop's elements dominate Spop's.

Dominance is defined as each element being strictly dominated (i.e., strictly preferred) by some Spop element.

**Sop (Support of Permission):**

List of elements:

support1: Organized north-hospital grants 'role hospital-doctor' the permission (analyze) on 'view admin data' if 'context referent-doctor holds'.

support2: ... (similar for other elements)

**Spb (Support for Prohibitions):**

Similarly, each support is an element on which prohibitions are applied.

**Preferences Between Elements:**

For each element, we have a list of relations.

E.g., 'The relation ""The organisation ... employes ... in role ... preferred to ...' etc.

Each preference is a relation where one element is considered 'preferred' over another, based on certain criteria.

These relations are used to determine dominance between Sop elements and Spop supports.

**Relating the Example Output to the Problem:**

In the problem, the output is structured with three sections: Decision Rule, Outcome, and Relations and Preferences.

I need to fill in those sections with the appropriate content.

**Decision Rule:**

According to the example's decision rule, it is stated as:

""Access is granting because for every permutation of the prohibitions, the conditions of the logic are satisfied.""

But in our case, the rule would be more specific, as it relates to the dominance conditions.

Wait, no. The decision rule is a general rule that applies to all cases, not specific to this example. But in our problem, we need to explain how it applies to this specific case.

**Outcome:**

It's about granting access because the conditions are met.

**Relations andPreferences:**

We need to list all the relations and their preferences that influence the decision.

For example, in the given example:

- The relation between 'organizational university1 employee' (the role assignment) and 'the context default' (another role) is preferred because 'secondee' is better than 'staff member'.
- Another relation is between 'context secondment' (which is a kind of context default) and another context preference.

I think the key is to list each relation and how it contributes to the decision process.

**Now, How to Model the Problem?**

Given the complexity, perhaps it's better to structure the code to parse the input correctly and then model the logic.

But since this is a thought process, perhaps we can outline the steps.

**Steps for Modeling:**

1. Parse the input to extract:

   a. The overall logic (condition for access).

   b. The supports of permission.

   c. The support of prohibitions.

   d. The relations (preferences) between elements.

2. For each relation, determine whether it is preferred or not.

3. For the specific problem, determine for each element whether it meets the dominance condition.

4. Based on the dominance, decide whether the condition is satisfied.

5. Finally, determine the outcome based on whether all prohibitions have satisfied their conditions.

**Implementing the Steps:**

But since I'm doing this manually, perhaps I can think of how to model it.

**Structuring the Output:**

Looking back at the user's instruction, they want the output in a specific format, with sections 1, 2, and 3, each containing specific content.

So:

- Section 1 (Decision Rule): This is the rule that the decision follows. For this problem, perhaps the rule is something like ""Access granted if all Sop supports dominate their respective Spb prohibitions.""

But given that the example uses specific terms, perhaps in the output, I can model the rule as a general statement, not tied to specific elements.

**Section 2 (Outcome):** The outcome will be a clear statement of whether the access has been granted.

**Sections 3 and 4:** These will detail the reasoning, explaining why the decision was made to grant access.

**Putting It All Together:**

So, the structured output would be as follows.

1.Decision Rule:
   The decision is based on ensuring that for every prohibition support (each Spb element), there exists an appropriate permission support (Spop element) that dominates it, according to the given relations.

   Or, more precisely, the logic is structured such that each Spop support must dominate the corresponding Spb support.

   However, the exact rule may vary based on how the input is parsed, but in general, it involves checking for dominance.

   But since the problem is to explain the reasoning process, not just the rule, the section should describe how the reasoning leads to the conclusion.

   So, in this case, it would explain how, given the input, certain relations are applied to determine that the access should be granted.

   For example:

   - For each support in the prohibited list (Spbs), we check if there's an appropriate support (Sops) where each element is dominated.

   - The relations between the elements (e.g., dominance between 'support1' in Spbs and 'support2' in Sops) determine whether this condition holds.

   Therefore, the Decision Rule would be a statement of the condition based on these relations.

But perhaps, to make it more precise, the Rule can be phrased as:

   Access is";0.47041015625;0.127777099609375;0.127777099609375;0.2486572265625;0.92138671875;0.07354736328125;0.9621212121212122;48.09;10.2;8.24;13.1;11.13;11.2

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

```

Your output for the example is the correct explanation, so your output for this problem should be similar.
To get started, you need to parse the input correctly. The input is given as a multi-line string, with each line representing a part of the input. The first line contains the overall logic. The second line is the supports of permission. The third line is supports of prohibition. The fourth line is preferences between elements.

So, the input is structured as follows:
- Line 1: Overall logic.
- Lines 2, 3, 4: Supports of permission, supports of prohibited, preferences.
- Each of these lines can contain multiple items, separated by newlines.

The task is to parse each line, extract the required information, and then apply the logic to determine access.

First, I'll parse line 1 to extract the condition for access. Then, parse lines 2 and 3 to get the supports and their respective prohibitions. Finally, process line 4 to get all the preferences.

Once I have all the information, I need to model the problem in a way that allows me to compute whether the access condition is met.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Parse the input into the required components.
   a. overall logic (condition for access).
   b. supports of permissions (each support is a list of elements).
   c. prohibitions (each is a support list).
   d. preferences (dictionary mapping relations to preferences).

2. For each support in the prohibitions, check if there's a corresponding permission support that dominates it according to the access rule.

3. The access rule is: for each prohibitive support, there must exist a permission support where each element is strictly dominated by the prohibitive's support.

4. If for all prohibitive supports, such a dominating permission support exists, then access is allowed. Otherwise, it's denied.

Now, let's think about how to represent the dominance.

Dominance between two supports: For each element in the permission support, it must be strictly greater than (prefered to) the corresponding element in prohibits support.

Wait, no. The dominance is such that for each element x in the permutation of the supports, x must be preferred to the corresponding y in the other support. So, for example, if the permutation is (x1, x2, x3), then x1 is preferred over y1, and x2 over y2, etc.

But wait, the problem statement says: ""each element of ... is strictly prefered to ..."". So, each element must strictly dominate the corresponding one in the prohibited support.

But how do we find such a permutation? Because for each prohibited support, we need to find a permutation of its elements, and check if for each i, the i-th element of that permutation is strictly preferable to the i'th element of its corresponding prohibited support's permutation.

Alternatively, perhaps the way to model this is to arrange the supports in a certain order, and for each, check whether in that order, the dominance condition holds.

But perhaps a better approach is to model each support as a set of elements with a specific order of preference.

For example, each support can be represented as a tuple of elements, each of which has a certain rank.

Then, for a given permutation of a support's elements, we can check whether for each position, the element's rank is higher than the corresponding rank in the forbidden support.

This seems a bit complex, but perhaps manageable.

Let's think step by step.

1. Read all the input lines.

2. Parse each line into the appropriate components.

   - The overall logic is the first line.
   - Line 2 is the list of supports for the permission (each element is a string, like ""The organisation ... applies to ..."").
   - Similarly, line 3 is the prohibits support (each string is an element).
   - Then, line4 is the preferences, which is a dictionary where each key is a relation string, and the value is the preferred relation (like 'liberal_doctor' preferred to ' extern', etc.)

3. For the logic:

   The condition is that for every prohibited support (support list), there exists some permission support (permutation of elements) where for each corresponding element, the permutation's element is more preferred than the prohibited's.

   So, the logic is: access granted iff for all s in prohibitions_supports:
       exists t in permissions_supports where for all i, t[i] > s[i]

   Now, how to compute this?

   Let's think of it as a problem of checking for each s in S_p (prohibition support) whether there exists an s_p in S_m (permission support) such that s_p dominates s.

   If all s_p's exist, access granted.

   Else, denied.

So the main challenge is to compute for each S_p, whether it is dominated by some S_m.

But computing this for all S_p could be computationally intensive if S_p is large, but given the problem constraints, perhaps it's manageable.

How to model S_p and S_m:

Each S_p consists of elements that have a certain preference order.

Similarly, each S_m also has elements with their own preference orders.

We can model each S as a list, and each element as having a rank (the order in which it is preferred).

For example:

For S_p = [A, B, C], the ranks could be A=1, B=2, C=3, with 1 being the most preferred.

For S_m = [D, E, F], their ranks are D=4, E=5, F=6.

If the permutation for S_m is [E, F, D], then E is 5, D is 4, F is 6.

We need to check if any permutation of S_m's elements dominates S_p.

A permutation P is a rearrangement of the S_m elements.

For each position i in P, P[i] must have a rank higher than S_p[i].

So, for S_p to be dominated by S_m, the ranks of P must be higher than those of S_p in each position.

Thus, the approach is:

For each s_p (support of prohibited):

   For each permutation P of s_m's support:

      Check if for all positions i, rank(P[i]) > rank(s_p[i]).

      If any permutation P satisfies this, then s_p is dominated, and we can stop checking for this s_p.

If none of the s_p are dominated by any s_m, then the access is denied.

Else, if all are dominated, access.

So now, the plan is:

- Parse all the data.

- For each s_m in s_m_supports:

   Generate all possible permutations of its support.

   Check for each permutation if it dominates any s_p support.

If any permutation dominates s_p, then proceed.

But generating all permutations could be time-consuming, especially if the support size is large.

However, given that the problem examples are manageable, perhaps this approach is feasible.

But for larger supports, the number of permutations is factorial(n), which can be very large. For example, a support of size 5 has 120 permutations, which may be manageable for small n, but for larger n, this approach becomes computationally infeasible.

Therefore, perhaps a smarter way is needed.

Alternative approach:

Instead of checking all permutations, perhaps find a way to determine if s_p can be dominated without enumerating all permutations.

How?

For s_p and s_m:

s_p has elements p1, p2, ..., pk.

s_m has elements m1, m2, ... mk.

Each pi and mi have ranks (i.e., their preference order).

We can think of s_p as a sequence of ranks: r_p1, r_p2,... r_pk.

Similarly for s_m: r_m1, ..., r_mk.

For s_m to dominate s_p:

We need that for some permutation (rearrangement) of m's elements (r_m1', r_m2', ..., r_mk'), each r_mi' > r_p_i.

But since r_m is a permutation, the sum of all r_m's is the same as r_p's, but their individual ranks can be arranged in any way.

So for s_p to not be dominated, s_m must not have a permutation where for every i, m_i' > p_i.

Which is equivalent to saying that s_m is not majorized by s_p. Wait, no, majorization is a different concept. Majorization is about whether one";0.3988271077473958;0.10328165690104167;0.1047210693359375;0.1312255859375;0.7548828125;0.0999755859375;0.9513307984790874;56.96;8.9;8.08;11.8;8.75;8.8

### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1902;221;"

The decision rule is based on the condition that for each supporting role of a prohibition, there must exist a corresponding supporting permission whose support strictly dominates the prohibitions' support. This dominance is determined by the preference relations between elements, where certain elements are preferred over others.

**Relation and Preference Analysis:**
1. For support 1 (org_west_hospital granting permission to perform consult on view_prescribe_data), the preference relation is such that the intern role is preferred over the patient role.
2. For the context relation, the context refers to whether the intern is present, and the preference is that the context holds between certain roles.
3. These relations are used to determine the dominance of permissions over prohibitions.

**Outcome:**
The outcome is the granting of access due to the dominance conditions met across all supporting roles of prohibitions. Specifically, each permission support element is strictly dominated by a corresponding prohibitions support element, meeting the condition for granting access.

**Conclusion:**
Access is granted as all permission support elements strictly dominate their respective prohibitions, satisfying the overall condition for access.";0.69091796875;0.57806396484375;0.42822265625;0.52490234375;0.9892578125;0.06585693359375;0.9943181818181818;26.2;14.5;14.43;16.7;17.0;17.2

### Structured Explanation

**1. Decision Rule:**
Access is granted under the condition where for every permutation (support) of a prohibitive role, there corresponds a permutation of a permissible role that strictly dominates the prohibitive support. Each element in a permissible support must strictly dominate the corresponding element in prohibitive supports.

**2. Outcome:**
The access was successfully granted due to the fulfillment of the dominance condition across all permutations of prohibitive and permissible roles.

**3. Relations and Preferences:**
- **Domination Check:** For each permutation of prohibited roles, there was a corresponding permutation of permissible roles where each element was strictly preferred.
- **Element Dominance:** For instance, the role ""hospital doctor"" in prohibitions was dominated by ""student"" in permissible roles, satisfying the strict dominance condition.

**4. Conclusion:**
Since all prohibitive permutations were dominated by permissible ones, access to the system was granted.

### Output:";1713;391;"

To determine whether the access to the system was granted, we need to analyze the logical conditions under which the decision was made. Here is the structured explanation:

### Decision Rule
Access is granted based on the following rule: For each support (or role assignment) of a **prohibition**, there must exist a corresponding **permission** support where the **permission's support** strictly dominates the **prohibited** support. This dominance is determined by the given preferences and relations between elements.

### Outcome
The decision rule leads to the conclusion that the access is **granted**. This conclusion is reached after evaluating the dominance conditions across all relevant supports and preferences.

### Relations and Preferences
The dominance conditions were evaluated as follows:
1. For the **support** of the **Prohibition** (e.g., specialist roles, context hours), we check if the **Permission** supports can strictly dominate these prohibitions.
   - Specialized roles (like specialist) are preferred over medical_secretaries, which are in turn preferred over student roles due to specific context preferences and dominance conditions.
   Specifically, the specialist role is preferred over the medical_secretor role, which is preferred in turn over the student role. This creates a chain of preferences where each role is strictly dominated by a more preferred role.

2. Additionally, the context preferences influence the decision:
   - The context of interest (like afternoon or morning) is evaluated for its dominance over prohibitions. For example, afternoon holds higher precedence over morning, which in turn holds precedence over context hours.
   These context preferences further contribute to the dominance chain, ensuring that the conditions for dominance are met.

By systematically evaluating each support and the corresponding permission support, along with the defined preferences, we conclude that all conditions for granting access are satisfied.

### Final Answer
The access was successfully granted due to the strict dominance of permission supports over the prohibitions, as evaluated by the defined decision rule and relations.";0.48544921875;0.06597137451171875;0.06597137451171875;0.38134765625;0.9384765625;0.0245208740234375;0.9870967741935484;26.81;14.2;12.86;16.1;16.3;16.8

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support:

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1674;263;"

To determine whether access is allowed, we analyze the provided input and apply the structured reasoning process.

### Decision Rule
The decision rule states that access to the system is granted only if for every restriction (support of a prohibition), there is a corresponding action (permission support) where the action's elements strictly dominate the restriction's elements. This dominance is based on predefined preferences.

### Relations andPreferences
The relations are as follows:
1. The preference ""Element A"" is preferred over ""Element B"" because ""A"" is more preferred than ""B"".
2. The relation ""Element C"" is not preferred to ""Element D"".
3. ""Element E"" and ""Element F"" are preferred to each other.

These preferences influence the determination of strict dominance between supports.

### Outcome
Based on the analysis, all restrictions have corresponding actions that strictly dominate their restrictions, thus granting access.

### Conclusion
Access is granted due to the strict dominance of each permission support over its corresponding restriction support, as dictated by the given preferences.

### Explanation

The decision to grant access is based on a structured logical inference that evaluates the conditions outlined in the problem statement. Here's how the decision was made:

**1. Decision Rule:**
Access is granted under the condition that for each ""support"" of a ""prohibition"" (i.e., each role assigned to perform a specific activity), there is a corresponding ""permission"" (role) where the ""permission's support"" strictly dominates the ""prohibited support."" Dominance here means that every element of one support is ""strictly preferred"" to or matches the other's support.

**2. Outcome:**
The outcome is that the permission ""Bob_Smith performs the activity 'performe'"" is granted for the activity ""modify on report personal_data.""

**3. Relations and Preferences:**
- For each permission, it was evaluated against the corresponding prohibited support:
  - The permission ""role X"" (where X is a role like "" nurse"" or "" doctor"") was compared to the prohibited support ""role Y.""
  - A relation was established where if ""role A"" is ""preferred"" over ""role B,"" it means ""A"" is strictly greater than ""B"" in terms of preference.
  - Specific relations were used to determine dominance:
    - ""Nurse"" > ""Student"" (from the given context preferences).
    - Similarly, other roles were compared based on context preferences.

- The context preferences were also considered, using relations like ""Emergency holds"" being preferred to ""No Anesthesia holds.""

By systematically comparing each permission against each prohibited support and applying the dominance and context preferences, the conclusion was reached that all conditions for granting access were satisfied.

### Final Answer
The access was **granted** because all permission supports strictly dominated their respective prohibited supports, as determined by the provided context and role preferences. Specifically, the permission to perform ""modify"" on ""report personal_data"" was found to strictly dominate its prohibited counterpart, satisfying the condition for access.";0.5558492024739584;0.08342742919921875;0.06733957926432292;0.76171875;0.97216796875;0.10540771484375;0.9695945945945946;25.49;14.7;14.18;16.3;15.37;17.3

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Structured Explanation

**1. Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted provided that for every condition (support) of a restriction (prohibited activity), there exists an associated condition of permissions (allowable activity) where each condition of the permissions is strictly dominated by the corresponding condition in the restrictions.

**2. Outcome:**  
The access for performing the prohibited activity on the specified support is granted as a result of meeting the domination conditions.

**3. Relations andPreferences:**  
- **Relation 1:** The relation between the ""South Hospital"" and ""West Hospital"" elements on the role hierarchy is preferred due to ""hospital-doctor"" being more preferred than ""extern"".  
  - **Reason:** ""Hospital_doctor"" (from South Hospital) is more preferred to "" extern"" (West Hospital), influencing the domination condition.  

- ** Relation 2:** The context preference between ""No Anesthesia Hold"" (South) and ""Anesthesia"" (East) is considered, as ""context no-anex"" is preferred in the South context over ""no_anesthesia"" in the West context.  

**4. Conclusion:**  
All conditions are met, allowing access to the specified activity.  

---

**Explanation:**

The decision to grant access was based on evaluating the conditions for each prohibited activity. By examining the relationships and preferences between different elements, it was determined that all required domination conditions were satisfied. This led to the conclusion that access was indeed granted.";0.8238677978515625;0.935791015625;0.935791015625;0.29248046875;0.98486328125;0.0295867919921875;0.9368932038834952;17.44;15.8;15.4;18.0;16.71;18.6

### Output:";1912;246;"

The decision rule is based on the condition that access is granting if for each supporting prohibition, a corresponding supporting permission exists, and each element in the permission support dominates that of the prohibitions. The outcome is the granting of access to the system, specifically due to the dominance condition between the permissions and prohibitions.

**Relations andPreferences:**
- The relation ""The organization west-hospital employs Katherine-Moore as a doctor"" is preferred over the relation ""the organization east-hospital applies for a doctor position"" because ""doctor"" is more preferred than ""extern.""
- The context ""emergency holds"" in the organization west has higher priority over the context ""no-anesthesia holds"" from the organization east because ""emergency"" is considered more important than ""no_anesthesia.""
- All these relations lead to the conclusion that the permission to perform on the activity is granted, as the permissions support dominates over the prohibutions.

### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";2020;606;"

The decision was made based on the overall logic of the system, which requires access to be granted only if certain conditions are met. The system evaluated the permissions and prohibitions of the users, considering their support and the preferences of other users.

### Structured Explanation:

**1.Decision Rule:**
Access is granted based on whether each user's permission support meets the criteria set by the prohibitions. For each restriction, there must exist a corresponding permission support where the support strictly dominates the restriction's support.

**2.Outcome:**
The access was successfully granted because all restrictions were satisfied, and the permission support met the dominance criteria.

**3.Relations andPreferences:**
- For the first restriction, the preference was that the user's role (surgeon) was preferred over another role (extern).
- The second and third restrictions compared roles (patient, external) and contexts (afternoon, no-anesthesia) respectively.
- All these comparisons were made to ensure that each restriction's prohibitions were met by the corresponding user's permissions.

**Conclusions:**
Since all conditions were met, access to the system was granted.

**Final Answer:**
1. The decision rule is based on ensuring each restriction is met by corresponding permissions.
2. The outcome was successful access granted.
3. The relations included user roles and contexts, with preferences determining which roles were preferred over others.

**Output:**

1. Decimal representation of $\frac{1}{9}$ is obtained by dividing 1 by 9, resulting in a repeating decimal of 0.111...
2. To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which involves dividing the larger number by the smaller one and taking the remainder, then repeating the process with the smaller number and the remainder until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

*Step 1: Identify the two numbers whose GCD needs to be found. Let's say the numbers are a and b, where a > b.*

*a. Divide a by b to get a quotient and a remainder.*

*b. Replace a with b and b with the remainder from the previous step.*

*c. Repeat the process until b becomes zero.*

*d. The value of b when it becomes zero is the gcd of the original two numbers.*

*e. If the original numbers are 18 and 24, for example, the process is as follows:*

18 ÷24 = 0 with a remainder of18

24 ÷18 =1 with remainder6

18÷6=3 with remainder0

Thus, gcd(18,24)=6*

*Using this method, you can find the gcd for any pair of numbers.*

**Conclusion:**

The GCD is found by repeatedly applying the division algorithm, reducing the problem size with each step, until only the gcd remains.";0.503400166829427;0.07494099934895833;0.07494099934895833;0.408203125;0.97314453125;0.01422882080078125;0.9837587006960556;45.76;11.1;11.6;13.5;11.66;12.6

        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Structured Output:

```
1. Relation and Decision Rule:
   The decision is based on the rule that for each element in the permission support, there must be a corresponding element in a prohibition support that is strictly dominated. This ensures that the permission contributes positively to meeting the prohibitions.

2. Decision Outcome:
   Access was granted because all required conditions were met, allowing the permission to dominate all prohibitions effectively.

3. Relational and Preference Data:
   - Dominance conditions were satisfied for all relevant elements, ensuring the permission could dominate each prohibited support.
   - Preferences were carefully considered, aligning the permission with the highest priority prohibitions.
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

**Decision Rule:**
The decision is made by ensuring that for every element supporting a prohibitive action, there's a corresponding permission element that strictly dominates it. This dominance ensures the permission meets the prohibitive requirements.

**Outcome:**
Access was granted due to the fulfillment of all dominance conditions, meaning each permission element strictly dominated its corresponding prohibitive support.

**Relational andPreference Data:**
- All elements supporting prohibitions were strictly dominated by their corresponding permission elements.
- Preferences aligned the permission elements with the most severe prohibitions, facilitating the successful granting of access.";0.43546218872070314;0.05731964111328125;0.054134368896484375;0.25146484375;0.912109375;0.09771728515625;0.9847715736040609;11.72;15.9;14.71;18.3;19.54;18.8

### Output:";2347;305;"

Here is a structured explanation of the decision process:

---

### Decision Rule
Access is granted when, for **every** support of **a** prohibition, there **exists** a corresponding **support** of a **permission** where the **permission's support** strictly dominates the **prohibition's** support in all relevant contexts.

### Outcome
The access was **granted** because all the necessary dominance conditions were met across the contexts and respective roles.

### Relations and Preferences
- **Domination Condition**: For each prohibitions support, ensure the corresponding permission supports dominate it in all contexts.
- **Context Preferences**: Preferences dictate which contexts are more preferred, influencing whether dominations are possible.

### Detailed Reasoning
1. Analyze each **support of a prohibition**:
   - For **support1** (emergent context), check if a permission's role dominates this support.
   - Repeat for **support2** (afternoon, morning) and **support3** (sample analysis).

2. Apply **dominance rules** across contexts. Dominated roles must be preferred in higher contexts.

3. Use **preferences** (e.g., ""intern > student"", ""emergency > afternoon"") to validate dominations.

4. If all dominations across contexts are valid, **access is granted**.

### Conclusion
All conditions were satisfied, granting **access**.

---

**Answer:**
Access was granted because all dominance conditions across contexts were met, ensuring permission support dominated prohibitions effectively.";0.4029535929361979;0.0537261962890625;0.051617940266927086;0.22900390625;0.982421875;0.302001953125;0.9848484848484849;24.24;13.2;12.2;14.3;17.62;18.1

### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";3245;202;"

### Decision Rule
Access is granted based on the condition that for every permutation of support in a prohibitive role, there must exist a corresponding permutation of a permissible role where the permissible role's support strictly dominates the prohibitive's support under the given preferences.

### Outcome
The outcome is that the access for the permission to perform `aOperate` on `patetemical_data` has been granted.

### Relations and Preferences
1. For the support `support 2` of prohibitions:
   - The relation ""The organisation west_east_hospital employs the role `surgeon`"" is preferred over the relation ""the organisation north_east has a role `student`"".
   - This preference is due to the context `no_anesthesia` being preferred over `morning`.
2. Additionally, for the permutation of prohibitive support, the permission support of `role doctor` is strictly dominated by `role external` in certain contexts, leading to the granting of access.";0.596156005859375;0.4955291748046875;0.3958953857421875;0.187744140625;0.97998046875;0.078369140625;0.9568345323741008;23.46;15.5;15.19;15.9;16.02;18.2

        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Explanation

The decision process for granting access is based on the following structured reasoning:

**1. Decision Rule:**
Access is granted **if and only** for every **support** of a **prohibition**, there **exists** a **corresponding** **permission** where the **permission's support** dominates the **prohibited** support.

**2. Outcome:**
The **access** is **granted** because **the permission** for **Henry_Lee** to **perform** **transfer** on **`pat.net`** meets the **dominance condition**.

**3. Relations and Preferences:**
- **Domination Condition:** For each **permutation** of the **permission's support**, each element must be **strictly preferred** to the corresponding element in **the prohibited support**.
- **Context Preferences:** Certain context-related preferences are considered, such as **""anesthetistic patient holds""** being preferred over other contexts, which influence the decision.

**Conclusion:**
By meeting the dominance condition and considering context preferences, the **access is granted**.";0.6051467895507813;0.114837646484375;0.0937347412109375;0.8359375;0.99365234375;0.01242828369140625;0.9921259842519685;19.67;14.9;14.18;16.3;17.8;21.7

### Output:";3006;287;"

Here is an explanation:

### Explanation:
The decision to grant access was made based on the following reasoning:

**1. Decision Rule:**
Access was granted if for every supporting role (prohibition) of a prohibited role, there existed a supporting permission whose role strictly dominated the prohibited role.

**2. Outcome:**
The access was successfully granted.

**3. Relations and Preferences:**
- For the first supporting permission (role 'intern', university west) and the corresponding prohibited role (under university west), the relation ""intern prefers patient"" was used. This satisfies the condition as ""intern"" strictly preferred ""patient"" over ""staff member"".
  
- Similarly, for the second supporting permission and prohibited role:
  - The role 'extern' (under east hospital) was strictly dominated by 'intern'.
  - This satisfied the condition due to the preference ""intern preferred patient"" in relation to the context.

- Finally, for all supporting permissions and prohibitions, the roles strictly dominated each other due to preference relations such as ""doctor preferred patient"", ""referent doctor preferred afternoon"", and ""anesthesi patient preferred sample analysis"".

### Conclusion:
Since all supporting roles of prohibitions strictly dominated their respective prohibited roles under the given context and preference relations, access to the system was granted.

Answer: Access was granted due to strict domination of permission roles over prohibitions under specified contexts and preferences.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

Here is an explanation of the decision process:

### Decision Rule:
Access is granted based on the condition that for every supporting role of a prohibitive role, a corresponding supporting permission exists where each role in the permission strictly dominates each role of the prohibitive support.

### Outcome:
The decision was made to grant access because all supporting roles of prohibitive roles were strictly dominated by the corresponding supporting permissions.

### Relations and Preferences:
1. For the support under the organization northhospital granting the role `surgeor` as a modification, the permission from the organization easthospital granting `specialist` strictly dominates this support.
2. The support under both northhospital and westhospital regarding `anest` was matched by a permission from westhospital under `specialty`, which strictly dominates `anesthetic`.
3. The third prohibited role under the context of `no_anest` and `after` was dominated by `select` under the same organization as ` specialist`, ensuring all conditions were satisfied.

### Conclusion:

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

```

To get started, I need to determine the correct decision rule based on the example provided. In the example, the decision was made by ensuring that for each prohibition support, there was a corresponding permission support where each element was strictly preferred. So, the rule seems to be that for every element in each support, it's strictly preferred in the permission support. 

In the given input, I have several supports of permissions and supports of prohibitions. Each support is a list of elements. For each support in the prohibitions, there must exist a corresponding element in the permissions support that is strictly more preferred. 

Wait, but in the example given, the logic was about each element being strictly preferred, not just dominance in the sense of element-wise. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine the example.

In the example input, the supports of the permissions (supports of permissions) are lists of elements, and for each such support, we need to find a corresponding permutation of the prohibits support. Wait, no, perhaps for each element in a support, the permission must dominate.

Wait, perhaps the rule is: For every element x in any of the oppositions (prohibitions' support), there must be an element y in the same support of permission such that x is strictly dominated by y. But wait, the example says that the outcome is that the permission (for Bob) is granted, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps it's more about the dominance of each element. For instance, if in one support, an element is in the support, and in another support, another element is required to be strictly dominated. But I'm not sure.

Let me look at the example's decision rule. It says: ""The outcome is determined by whether, for all elements in any support, each element is strictly dominant in the corresponding permission."" So, for a given support in a prohibition, the corresponding support in permission must have each element strictly dominated.

So, for example, if a prohibitions support has an element x, then in the permutation, the same element x must appear in a permission support that strictly dominates it. If this is true for all x in all prohibitions' supports, then the condition is met.

But in the given problem, the input consists of several supports for permissions and several for prohibitions.

So the steps would be:

1. Enumerate all the elements in each of the permutation (the supports) for both prohibitions and permissions.

For each support (permutation) in prohibitions:

   For each element (x) in this support:

      Check if there exists an element (y) in a permutation (support of permission) such that y strictly dominates x.

      If for any x, such a y does not exist, then access is denied.

2. If for all such x, y exists, then condition is satisfied, access granted.

But wait, in the initial example, for instance, the permutation for Bob's support has elements: the role assignment, and the context. So for each of these elements, we check if they are strictly dominated in the respective permission support.

For example, in Bob's permission support (role assignment and context), each element must be dominated by some element in their respective permutation.

But perhaps the way to structure this is to:

- For each permutation in the prohibited support:

   - For each x in this permutation:

      - Find if there's a y in any permutation (for permission support) where y is strictly greater than x (i.e., strictly preferred).

      - If for some x, no such y exists in any permission permutation, then overall condition is not met.

   - If all x's are dominated, proceed to the next permutation.

- Repeat this for all permutations in prohibited support.

- If all permutations are satisfied, condition met; else, condition not met (access denied).

So, in our problem, we have several permutations (support lists) for each.

We need to check for each permutation (from prohibitions) whether for every x in that permutation, there is a corresponding y in some permutation (of permissions) that dominates x. If even one x fails this, access denied.

Thus, the process is:

For each permutation s in the list of prohibited support permutations:

   flag = True

   for x in s:

      found = False

      for p in list of permission permutations:

          for y in p:

              if dominance(y, x) is true:

                  found = true

                  break

      if not found:

          flag = false

          break

   if not flag:

       return denied

If all s are passed, return granted.

So now, the problem is to implement this logic given the input.

Now, let's look at how the input is structured.

The input is divided into two sections:

- The first section describes the overall logic.

- The second section is the input for the logic.

Looking at the input, for the second section, the structure is:

2. Support of Permission: List of elements that make up the support.

Each of these lists is a permutation for the permission.

Similarly, the third section has:

3. Support for Prohibition: Each list is the permutation.

Then, the fourth section lists the preferences between the elements.

So for the problem, I can ignore the first section and focus on the second, third, and fourth sections.

So to model this in code, I'll need:

- A list of permutations for permissions (each permutation is a set of elements in a certain order).

- A set of preferences between elements, which tells us which elements are preferred over others.

So step by step, the code will be:

Read the input and process it into:

- perms_for_permission: list of sets, each set is a support (list of elements) for permission.

   Each set is in order, as given in the problem statement.

- prefs: a dictionary where for each pair of elements (a, b), we know whether a is preferred over b.

   For example, prefs['a']['b'] is True if a is considered more preferred than b.

Once we have these, we can proceed to check the condition.

So let's think about how to represent the data.

First, read the input as per the given structure.

The second part of the input (the structure) is as follows:

- 2nd section: permutations of permissions.

Each permutation is given as a list, e.g., for support 1 of permission: [element1, element2, element3]

- 3rd section: support of prohibations.

Each list is similar.

- 4th section: the preferences, which is a dictionary mapping each element to the elements it's preferred over.

So in code:

We can read the four sections, process them, and extract the required data.

Let's outline the steps in code.

1. Read the input:

   Read the entire input as a string.

   Split it into sections based on semicolons.

   The first part is the logic, which we can ignore.

   Then, split the rest into sections.

   Section 2: the permutations for the permissions.

   Sections 3 and 4 are the permutations and preferences.

   So:

   sections = input.split(';')

   logic_part = sections[0]

   other_parts = sections[len(logic_part)+1 : ]

   So sections[1], [2], [3], [4] correspond to the other parts.

   Now, process sections 1, 2, 3, 4.

   section1 is sections[2], which is the structure of the problem.

   Let's process section1:

   It's a series of lists, each representing a support for permission or prohib.

   We can split this into a list.

   perm_for_permission = []

   for s in section1.split('\n'):

       if s.strip() == '': continue

       perm = list(map(str.strip, s.strip().split(',')) )

       perm.sort()  # Not sure if needed, but perhaps.

       perm_forPermission.append(perm)

   Similarly, section3 is the support for prohib:

   support_for_prohibitions = [s.strip() for ... ]

   Then section4 is the preferences:

   prefs = {}  # key is element, value is list of preferred elements.

   for element in section4:

       prefs[element] = [ ... list ... ]

So once we have the perms for permissions, the support lists for prohibs, and prefs, the next step is to process these to check whether the condition holds.

Next, process each permutation of prohibs to see if each element can be dominated in some permission permutation.

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision:

### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";2812;315;"

### Structured Output

**Example Input:**
1. Overall Logic: Explanates the condition for access granting based on prohibitions and permissions.
2. Supports of Permission: Lists elements for permissions (role assignment, role dominance).
3. Context of Prohibitions: Details the conditions for prohibitions.
4. Preferences: Preferences between elements.

**Example Output:**
The decision was made to grant access based on the following structured analysis.

**1. Decision Rule:**
Access is granted under the rule that for each prohibitive support, there must exist a corresponding permission support where the former strictly dominates the latter. Domination is defined as each element in the permission support being strictly preferred.

**2. Outcome:**
In this case, the permission granted is for `Charlie_Brown` to perform `delegate` on `patinet_medICAL_DATA_2`, which is granted due to strict dominance.

**3. Relations and Preferences:**
- **Domination Conditions:**
  - The permission support for `Characteristics_Brown Performing Delegation` is strictly dominated by the prohibitions' support.
  - Domination occurs because the support elements are preferred over the prohibitive elements.
- **Element Domination:**
   - The role assignment `Hospital_doctor` is preferred over `Extern`.
   - Context preferences like `Anesthesic_Patients` and `Referent_Doctor` are considered to determine the outcome.

**4. Conclusion:**
All conditions for access are satisfied, leading to the granting of access for the specified permission.";0.5999715169270834;0.11612955729166667;0.095947265625;0.96923828125;0.9013671875;0.08282470703125;0.9653465346534653;23.53;13.4;12.53;15.0;18.32;17.3

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

|The decision is based on whether each support's permission has a dominating support in the prohibitions. The overall rule is that for each prohibitory support, there must be a corresponding permission support that dominates it. The outcome in this example is that Yara's permission to perform 'aOperate' is granted, as her support is dominated by a prohibiting support. The relations include 'support 3 of permission' dominating 'support X of prohibitions'. The preferences are that certain relations are preferred over others, such as 'context emergency holds' being preferred to 'context morning holds', which affects the outcome. The decision is made by evaluating all relations and their preferences to determine the final outcome. So, the access is denied if there are no dominating relations, or if the domination is not consistent with the preferences. In this example, the relations show that each supporting permission is dominated, and the domination respects the context preference, leading to the access being granted. 

**Your Input:**
The overall logic, the supports of permission and prohibitions, the preferences between elements, etc.

**Output:**
Please provide the structured output as specified in the problem statement.

Now, let's move on to the actual thinking process for the problem.
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this problem. Let's start by understanding what the problem is asking for.

The problem is about determining whether access to a system is granted based on certain logic rules. The input consists of several parts, and I need to process them according to the given logic rules.

First, I'll look at the overall logic provided. It seems that access is allowed only if certain conditions are met. From the example explanation, I can see that the decision is determined by checking if for each supporting role of a prohibitory element, there's a corresponding supporting role in the permissions that dominates the prohibitory one. The dominance is checked by looking at each element in the permission support and seeing if it strictly dominates the prohibiting support.

So, the key steps are:

1. Identify all the supporting roles of each prohibiting element.
2. For each such supporting role, check if it dominates the corresponding prohibiting support.
3. If all dominating roles are found for every prohibiting support, then access is granting. Otherwise, it's denied.

Now let's break down the input structure.

The input is divided into sections:

- Overall Logic
- Supports of Permission
- supports of Prohibitions
- Preferences Between Elements

I'll need to read each of these sections and extract the necessary information.

Starting with the Overall Logic. It's a bit abstract, but from the example, it seems that the logic is about whether each prohibiting support has a corresponding dominating permission support.

Moving on, the next section is the Supports ofPermission. This lists all the elements (roles) that are supporting the prohibitive actions. Each of these supports is a list of elements that make up the supporting role.

Similarly, the SupportsofProhibitions section lists the elements of each prohibitive support.

Then, the Preferences section lists how certain relations between elements are preferred. For example, certain relations like 'context referent holds' are preferred to others.

Once I have all this information, I should process it step by step.

Let me outline the steps I'll take based on the problem analysis.

Step 1: Understand the Decision Rule.

From the example output, I see that each step is structured as:

- Decision Rule
- Outcome
- Relations and preferences

I need to explain why the decision was made (yes or no) and the reasoning behind it (how the rules were applied).

Step 2: Process the Input.

I'll read each section of the input.

1. Overall Logic: I don't think it's necessary to process this as much as I process the other sections, but I'll read it anyway to see if any patterns emerge.

2. SupportsofPermission: Each line here is a supporting role. Each supporting role is a set of elements. So for each line in this section, the elements are the supporting elements of that role.

For example, in the first part of the supportsofpermission section, there are three supporting roles: role1, role2, role3.

Each of these roles has its own supporting elements, which are lists of elements.

So for each role in supportsofPermission, I have to collect the elements.

Same for supportsofProhibition: each line represents a prohibitive role, and each line has its supporting elements.

Then comes the preferences section, which lists the relations between the elements and how they are preferred.

I think the next step is to collect all the information into data structures that can be easily processed.

So I'll create:

- A data structure for each of the sections (supports of permission, supports of prohibit, preferences).

- For each section, I will have:

  - A list of supporting elements for permission.

  - Similarly, a list for prohibit.

  For the preferences, a dictionary where the keys are the relations and values are the preferences.

Wait, but in the input, each section has multiple lines. So I'll have to process each section line by line.

So the plan is:

- Read each section's lines.

- For the sections, process each line into the appropriate data structure.

- Then, process the data structures to compute the decision.

Let's think about how to represent the data.

For the section 'supports of permissions':

Each line is a role, like 'support1', 'support2', etc. Each line's supporting elements are a list, like [element1, element2, ...].

So for this section:

- We can have a list where each element is a tuple containing the role name and the list of its elements.

Similarly for the 'prohibitions' section.

Then for the preferences:

A dictionary where each key is a relation string (e.g., 'support x') and the value is the preference string (like 'is preferred to ...').

Once the data is structured, we can process it as follows.

Processing:

For each prohibiting role, we need to check for each corresponding permission role whether the permission role's elements dominate the prohibiting role's element.

But wait, how is the domination determined? It's based on each element being strictly greater than the prohibiting element.

In the problem explanation, for example, a relation like 'A is supported' is preferred over 'B is supported', meaning 'A' is more dominant than 'B'.

So, to compute whether a permission is dominating a prohibiting element, we have to check each supporting element of each permission whether it is strictly greater in each element compared to the prohibiting.

But how do we represent this in code?

I think for each permission and prohibiting element pair, we'll check if each of its supporting element's elements is strictly dominated by the prohibiting's element. If for all elements, the supporting element is strictly larger, then it's a dominating relation.

So in code:

We can have for each permutation:

permutation = {
    'role': r,
    'support': s
}

domination = check if s_dominates r

Which is:

for each element e in s:
    if e is not strictly larger than r:
        domination = False
        break

If all pass, then domination is True.

So now, the steps in code would be:

- For all permutations, check whether their supporting role dominates their prohibiting role.

- If any permutation's supporting role does not dominate its prohibiting, then the overall result is denied.

- Else, if all permutations are successfully dominated, the result is granting.

So putting it all together.

In code:

Read each section.

For each section:

Section 1 (Overall Logic):

We can ignore it for now, but perhaps it's needed to get the structure.

Section 2 (Support of Permission):

Read each line, and for each, extract the role and the elements. Store this in a list.

So:

support_of_permission = [
    {'role': role, 'elements': elements}
    for role, elements in lines
]

Similarly for support_of_prohibition.

Section3 (Preferences):

Read all the preference lines, and store them in a dictionary, where keys are relation strings, values are preference strings.

Once all sections are processed, the code can proceed to process these data structures.

Next steps:

- Process each permutation (support of permission) and";0.5588630676269531;0.20753987630208334;0.1085039774576823;0.59716796875;0.9619140625;0.080810546875;0.9886201991465149;48.6;10.0;7.96;12.8;11.42;10.9

        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

To solve this problem, we need to determine whether access to a specific project is granted based on the given logic. The logic involves checking permissions and prohibitions for different roles and elements. The decision rule is based on whether each support (prohibition) has a corresponding permission that dominates the support. 

### Approach
The approach involves the following steps:
1. Identify the supports of the permissions and the prohibitions.
2. Determine the preferences between the elements using the provided relations.
3. Check if each permission support dominates each corresponding prohibition support.
4. If all conditions are met, grant access; otherwise, deny access.

### Solution Code
```python
# Read the input logic
overall_logic = {
    'Overall Logic': ""..."",
    # ... (rest of the logic)
    'Decision Rule': ""..."",
    'Outcome': ""..."",  # This is where we provide the explanation
    'Relations andPreferences': ""...""
}

# Extract the necessary parts for the problem
# For the given example, the input is structured as follows:
# The input is split into lines, with the first line being the overall logic.
# The subsequent lines contain the details of supports of permissions, supports of prohibitions,
# and the preferences.

# We need to parse these lines to extract the relevant information.

# Let's think about how to structure the code to handle this.

# First, read the input and split it into lines.
lines = [line.strip() for line in open().read().splitlines()]
n = len(lines)
if n == 0:
    # Handle empty input, but according to problem statement, input is non-empty.
    pass
else:
    first_line = lines[0].splitlines()
    if first_line[0] != ""Overall Logic: ..."":
        # Handle unexpected first line.
        pass
    else:
        # Process the rest of the lines.

        # Split the input into sections based on line breaks.
        sections = []
        for i in range(1, len(lines), 2):
            section = lines[i].split('\n')
            sections.append(section)
        # sections will be a list of sections, each section containing the logic for permissions, prohibitions, etc.
        # Now, process each section.

        sections_per_section = {}
        for section in sections:
            lines_in_section = section
            if not lines_in_sec:
                continue
            parts = []
            for p in range(len(lines_in_sec)):
                if p % 2 == 1:
                    # Skip empty lines
                    continue
                else:
                    if p < len(lines_in_section):
                        section_content = lines[p].strip()
                        if section_content:
                            parts.append(section_content)
                    else:
                        break
            sections = sections + [parts]

        # The sections are now a list where each element is a section (e.g., 'Permissions', 'Prohibitions', etc.)

        # For each section, extract the details.
        for s in sections:

            if s.startswith('Permissions'):
                # Process permissions
                perms = []
                for perm_line in s:
                    perm_line = perm_line.strip()
                    if not perm_line:
                        continue
                    perms.append(perm_line)

                if not perms:
                    continue

                # Similarly, process prohibitions
                prohibitions = []

                for p_line in permutations(perms, len(perms)):
                    # Wait, no, it's better to process each permutation as a support.

                    # But in the problem, each support is a list. So perhaps for each permutation, the support is the list of elements.
                    # So for each line in s, if it's a permutation, split into elements and process.

                # This part is getting a bit complicated. Let me think of a different approach.

            Alternatively, perhaps the code can be structured to read each section and extract the required information step by step.

            Another approach is to parse each section line by line.

            Let's try to restructure the code.

            So, in the code, after reading the input lines, we can split them into sections. Each section is either a permutation of permissions or prohibitions or preferences.

            Then, within each section:

            - For permissions, collect all the elements in each support line.
            - Similarly for prohibitions.

            For the preferences, collect the relations between elements.

            Once all sections are parsed, the next step is to compute for each element whether it has a higher priority than others.

            Wait, perhaps it's easier to represent the preferences as a dictionary where each key is an element, and the value is another dictionary mapping elements to whether one is preferred over the other.

            But given the complexity, perhaps in the interest of time, I can find a way to simulate the decision process.

            However, given the time constraints, perhaps I'll proceed with the code structure as per the example.

            Looking at the example output, the code needs to read the sections, and for each section (permutations), extract the elements, and then compute the dominance.

            Now, for the example input, the sections are:

            Section 1: Overall Logic
            Sections 2, 3, 4: Support of Permissions, Support of Prohibitions, Preferences

            Each section has certain lines. For instance, section 2 (Support of Permissions) has three lines, each representing a support line for each role.

            Each line in the section is a permutation. For example, in support of permissions section, lines 1,2,3 represent the support for role1, role2, role3.

            Similarly, each permutation represents a support for roles.

            The code will need to process these permutations, collect their elements, then determine for each such permutation whether it dominates the corresponding permutation in prohibitions (i.e., each element in the permutation is strictly dominated in the corresponding prohibitions).

            The dominance condition is that for every element in a permutation (support of a prohibition), there exists an element in its corresponding permutation support (of a permission) such that the permutation element strictly dominates the prohibition element.

            To implement this:

            For each permutation in the permissions support section:

                For each element, check if it is strictly better than the corresponding element in prohibition support.

                If any element fails this condition, then the access is denied.

            If all elements pass, then access is allowed.

            Therefore, in code:

            Read the sections as described.

            Extract the permutations for permissions support.

            Also extract the corresponding permutations from prohibitions support for each.

            Compute the dominance condition.

            Finally, decide based on access.

            Putting it all together:

            So the code would look something like:

            # Read input lines
            lines = [list(line.strip().replace('\n', '\n').replace('\t', '\t').replace(' ', ' '), .strip().replace('>', '<'), .strip()) .strip() for .strip, line in lines]

            # Split into sections as per problem statement
            # Each section starts with an even index (1,3,5,...)
            # So sections = [lines[1], lines[3], ..., lines[2k-1]]
            # The problem statement says that each section starts at an odd index.

            # Let's create a list called sections, where each section contains all the lines at that index.
            # For example:
            # sections = [
            #     lines[1],
            # ]
            # Then, for sections[0], it's the first section, sections[1] is the second, etc.

            if len(lines) < 2:
                # No sections
                sections = []

            else:
                first_section_index = 1
                while True:
                    current_section = lines[first_section_index]
                    sections.append(current_section)
                    next_index = current_section_index + 2
                    if next_index >= len(lines):
                        # No more sections
                        break

                    # Check if the next section is empty
                    next_section_empty = False
                    for _ in range(next_index):
                        if not next_section.empty:
                            break

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization north_hospital grants the role anesthetist the Permission to perform the activity validate on the view sample if the context emergency holds,The organisation north_hospital employes Liam_Taylor in the role anesthetist, The organisation central_hospital considers sign as a validate activity, The organisation north_hospital uses patinet_medical_data_1 in the view sample, The context emergency holds between Liam_Taylor, sign, and patinet_medical_data_1 in the organisation north_hospital,  
(support 2): The organization south_hospital grants the role liberal_doctor the Permission to perform the activity validate on the view personal_data if the context referent_doctor holds,The organisation south_hospital employes Liam_Taylor in the role liberal_doctor, The organisation central_hospital considers sign as a validate activity, The organisation south_hospital uses patinet_medical_data_1 in the view personal_data, The context referent_doctor holds between Liam_Taylor, sign, and patinet_medical_data_1 in the organisation south_hospital,  
3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
(support 1): The organization west_hospital grants the role student the Prohibition to perform the activity validate on the view admin_data if the context sample_analysis holds,The organisation west_hospital employes Liam_Taylor in the role student, The organisation central_hospital considers sign as a validate activity, The organisation west_hospital uses patinet_medical_data_1 in the view admin_data, The context sample_analysis holds between Liam_Taylor, sign, and patinet_medical_data_1 in the organisation west_hospital,  
4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation north_hospital employes Liam_Taylor in the role anesthetist, `` is preferred to ``The organisation west_hospital employes Liam_Taylor in the role student, `` because: anesthetist is preferred to student. 
The relation ``The context emergency holds between Liam_Taylor, sign, and patinet_medical_data_1 in the organisation north_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context sample_analysis holds between Liam_Taylor, sign, and patinet_medical_data_1 in the organisation west_hospital, `` because: emergency is preferred to sample_analysis. 
The relation ``The organisation south_hospital employes Liam_Taylor in the role liberal_doctor, `` is preferred to ``The organisation west_hospital employes Liam_Taylor in the role student, `` because: liberal_doctor is preferred to student. 
The relation ``The context referent_doctor holds between Liam_Taylor, sign, and patinet_medical_data_1 in the organisation south_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context sample_analysis holds between Liam_Taylor, sign, and patinet_medical_data_1 in the organisation west_hospital, `` because: referent_doctor is preferred to sample_analysis. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Liam_Taylor to perform sign on patinet_medical_data_1 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1696;360;"

### Structured Output:

1. Decision Rule:  
   The decision is based on ensuring that for every element of a prohibited support, there is a corresponding element in a permissible support where the permissible's support strictly dominates the prohibited's support.

2. Outcome:  
The outcome is that the access to the system is granted due to the dominance of the permissible support over the prohibited support for all relevant elements.

3. Relations and Preferences:  
- For each element in the prohibited supports, a corresponding permissible support exists.  
- Each permissible support element is strictly dominated by a corresponding prohibited support element.  
  - Dominance conditions are satisfied across all elements, leading to the granting of access.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

**1. Overall Logic:**
Access is granted based on the condition that for each restriction (prohibition), there must exist a corresponding permission such that the permission support strictly dominances the restriction support.

**2. Decision Process:**
For each restriction support (e.g., ""permission support""), we check if there's a matching permission support that strictly dominates it. The dominance is determined by comparing elements of both supports.

**3. Domination Check:**
- For the restriction ""Liam_Taylor performs sign"" (permitted to perform), we find a permission support where each element (sign) is strictly more dominant than the restriction.
- Similarly, for other restrictions like ""student performs Prohibition,"" we ensure the corresponding permission supports dominate these prohibitions.

**4. Preferences and Dominance:**
Element-wise comparison is used to determine dominance. If a permission element strictly dominates a restriction element, it meets the condition for granting access.

**5. Conclusion:**
All elements of permissible support strictly dominate the corresponding elements of restriction support, thus granting access.";0.512646484375;0.0502471923828125;0.0454559326171875;0.748046875;0.94287109375;0.223388671875;0.9888888888888889;20.99;14.4;12.19;16.4;16.93;16.6

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

**

Now, let's try to come up with an example. The example input is given, and the example output is given. I need to apply the same logic to the provided input.

The input is as follows:

1. Overall Logic:
   - Explain condition for access.
   - Access granted if for each prohibition support, there's a permission support where permission's supports dominate the prohibitions' supports. Domination means each perm support element is strictly dominated by a prop support element.

   - Details:
      - Support 1: Organization east-hospital grants role Liberal-doctor to perform on view prescr.
      - ... (and so on for all supports and preferences)
   - Decision: Access granted because permission support (Rachel-Baker on prop_3) dominates prohibitions support.

2. Relation Rules:
   For each relation, specify which relations are preferred.

3. Preferences:
   Each relation has a preferred relation.

Wait, perhaps it's better to structure the input as per the example.

In the example input, the overall logic is broken down into several sections, each describing a rule. Each rule is a decision rule.

Let me try to parse the given input correctly.

The given input seems to be a structured format, similar to the example provided.

Looking at the problem statement, the input is a block of text that represents the logic, with specific sections.

The first line is the Overall Logic. It explains the condition for accessing the system.

Then, the next lines are structured as:

2. Support of Permission: List of elements (support_1, support_2, etc.), each describing the role of that support.

Similarly, for Prohibition.

Then comes the preferences between the elements.

So, the structure is:

- Overall Logic
- Supports of Permission
- Preferences Between Elements
- Prohibition
- Relations Between Prohibition and Permissions
- Decision Rule
- Conclusion

Wait, but in the example, the decision is based on whether each permission support's elements are strictly dominated over the corresponding prohibitions.

So in the input, for the example:

- The overall logic defines the condition, which is that for every prohibition support (i.e., for each element in the support), there must exist a corresponding permission support element where the permutation's support strictly dominates the prohibition's support.

Domination is defined as each element being strictly preferred. So for each such element, the permission support must have each element that is strictly more preferred than the corresponding element in prohibition.

So the decision process is:

For each support in prohibitions:

   Find a support in permissions where, for all elements in this permission support, each element is preferred (as per the preference rules) to the same element in prohibiting support.

   If such a support exists for all prohibitions, then access granted.

Else, access denied.

So to model this, we need to:

- Enumerate all the support elements for prohibitions and permissions.

- For each support element of a prohibition, find a support element in permissions that dominates it.

- If for every prohibition support, such a dominating permission support exists, proceed; else, deny access.

Now, in terms of the structured output, the user provided an example input and output, which I can use as a template.

The user's example:

Input is a structured block, which when parsed, results in an explanation.

The output is structured with three sections, as per instructions.

So for the given problem, I'll parse the input into these sections, and then explain how the decision was made.

Let's think about the steps to take.

1. Parse the Input into the correct sections.

   The input is divided into:

   - Overall Logic (1st line)
   
   - 2nd line: Details of Overall Logic.
   
   Then, starting from line 3, the sections are:

   Each section is separated by newlines.

   So, the first section after Overall Logic is:

   3rd line: Support ofPermission
   4th line: details of that section
   Then comes line 6: preferences between elements.
   Then line 7: Prohibition details.
   Line 8: relations between Prohibitions and Permissions.
   Finally, line 9: decision rule and conclusion.

   Wait, no. Let me re-examine the problem's example input.

   Looking at the example's input, it's structured as lines 1 to 9.

   1 line: Overall Logic.

   Then lines 2-3: Details.

   Lines 4-6: Preferences between elements.

   Line7-9: Details for Prohibited.

   Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the input structure is more like:

   Overall Logic

   Supports of permission

   Preferences

   Prohibition

   Relations

   Decision rule

   Conclusion

   But perhaps the details for each section are separated by lines.

   In any case, the approach is to parse each section, then model the logic.

But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps I can structure the code to parse these sections.

But perhaps for the problem, the code can be written as follows.

First, read the input and split into sections.

Each section can be processed to extract the relevant information.

For example, each section (like Overall Logic, Details, etc.) can be split into lines, and each line can be parsed into a data structure.

But given that the problem is to write code, perhaps using Python, I can read the entire input, split into tokens, and process each token into a structured data.

Alternatively, perhaps we can process the input line by line, but it's easier to read all lines at once and process them.

So here's the plan:

- Read all lines of the input.

- Split the lines into sections based on line breaks (like \n).

- Process each section:

   For Overall Logic:

      The first section (line 1) contains the overall condition.

      The Details section (lines 2 and 3) describe the details of the condition.

   For the Details section:

      It contains the supports of permission and prohibits.

      It also includes the relations between elements (e.g., preference rules).

   The Relations section (after the Details) describes the relationships between the pros and cons.

   And then the Conclusion section.

Once all sections are processed, we can model the problem.

So now, in code:

Read all lines into a list.

Split into sections (each section is a list of lines).

Then, process each section.

For section 1 (Overall Logic):

   It has an overall condition, but perhaps for our problem, we don't need to process it further.

   But for the details, it may contain:

      - Overall condition: access granted if certain condition is met.

      - Details include:

         - Support of permission: list of elements.

         - Prohibition support: list.

      Also, in the Details, there are relations, which are the preferences.

So perhaps, for our code, we'll process sections 2, 4, 6, and 8.

Section 2: Details (overall logic):

   The details include:

      Overall condition (but perhaps not needed).

      Support of permissions.

      Prohibition supports.

      Relations (preferences between elements).

Section 4: Relations:

   It describes the preferences (which are the rules for dominance).

So, for relations, we have:

   A relation is a statement like ""element A is preferred over element B"".

   These are used to determine dominance between supports.

Section6: Details:

   Same as section 2.

Section8: Conclusion:

   The conclusion gives the final decision.

So putting it all together.

In code, the steps would be:

Read the input lines.

Process each section as per above.

In particular, for section 4 (relations):

   Each line is a relation.

   We can parse these into a dictionary, where the keys are the relation strings, and values are the preferred relations.

But wait, the relations are binary: for example, relation 'A is preferred' is a key, and its value is 'B is preferred'.

So for each line in section4:

   Split into left and right parts.

   Left is the relation string, right is the preferred relation string.

   Add this to a relations dictionary: key is left, value is right.

So relations = { 'A': 'B', 'C': 'D', ... }

Then, in section8, the conclusion is given.

In section8:

   Conclusion: The outcome is described.

   It says something like, ""The outcome is: ...""

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";1956;1799;"```
1. Decision Rule: ...
2. Outcome: ...
3. Relations and Preferences: ...
```

To get started, I need to understand the example given. The example input is a bit complex, but breaking it down into steps can help.

In the example input, the overall logic is given as an explanation of the condition for access. Then, the supports of permission and prohibitions are listed. The preferences between elements are also provided. The decision rule in the example is given, and the outcome is explained.

Now, for the problem at hand, I'll need to analyze the given input and determine how the access decision was made. I'll have to go through each part step by step, making sure I understand the relationships and preferences, and how they contribute to the decision.

Let me start by parsing the input. The input is divided into two main sections: the Overall Logic and then the details. The Overall Logic gives the conditions for access, which is explained in the problem statement. The details section lists the supports for permissions, the prohibitions, and their preferences.

I think the first step is to parse each of these sections. Let's look at each part:

1. Overall Logic:
   - The condition is explained as: For each support (prohibition), check if there's a corresponding permission support where each element is strictly dominated.
   - Dominance is defined as each element in the permission support being strictly preferred.

2. Supports of Permission:
   Each support is a list of elements. For example, support 1 for the permission includes various organizations and roles, each with their own conditions (e.g., 'context intern' or 'context default holds').

3. Support of Prohibitions:
   Similar structure, but for prohibitions.

4. Preferences:
   A list of relations between elements, indicating which are preferred over others.

Once I have all these parsed, I can model the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem. The goal is to determine whether all prohibitions have their conditions met by the permissions, using the given preferences.

Let's think about how to model this.

For each support in a prohibition, we need to find a support in the corresponding permission that dominates it. The dominance is determined by the preference relations between the elements.

So, the plan is:

- For each prohibitive support, iterate through each of its elements.
  - For each such element, find a permission support that has all elements strictly dominated by the prohibitive element's support.
- If for any element, no such permission support exists, the access is denied.
- Otherwise, if all elements are dominated, then access is allowed.

But how do we efficiently find such permission supports? We need to model the dominance relationships and check for each element whether it can be covered by some permission support.

Given that the preferences are given as a list, we can represent them as a directed graph, where an edge from A to B indicates that A is preferred over B. This graph will help us determine the order of preference.

Wait, but the problem states that the decision is based on dominance. So, for two elements A and B, if A is dominated by B (i.e., A is strictly better than B), then B should come first in the preference chain.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to represent the preferences as a dictionary, where each key is an element, and its value is the preferred element (or None if it's the top in the hierarchy).

Wait, no. According to the example, the preference is such that certain elements are preferred to others. For instance, 'The relation ""The organisation southern_hospital ... holds between ...' is considered preferred to another relation.

So perhaps, each element has a preferred relation, which could be another element or None (if it's not preferred).

But in our case, the relations are already given, so for each pair of elements, we know which is preferred. So we can create a mapping from each element to its preferred element.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each edge A->B indicates that B must come before A in the processing order. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait no, the dominance is the key here. For a given element A, any element B that dominates A must be preferred to A. So for each A, we must find a B such that B dominates A.

So the approach is:

For each element A in a prohibited support:

   Find if there exists an element B in any permission support such that:

      For all elements C in A's support:

          C is strictly less preferred than B.

   If such a B exists for all A, then proceed. Otherwise, deny access.

So how can we model this? Let's see.

We can represent each element's preferred relation as a mapping. For each element X, we have a preferred element P(X). If P(X) is None, then X is the top preference and cannot be dominated by any other element.

But wait, according to the problem's overall logic, the condition is that for each prohibited support, there must be a corresponding permissible support where the permissible's support strictly dominates the prohibited's support.

So for each X in the prohibited support's elements:

   There must exist a Y in the permissible supports such that Y strictly dominates X.

Thus, for Y to dominate X, Y must be strictly preferred over X.

Therefore, the problem reduces to checking, for all X in prohibited, whether there exists Y in permissible such that P(Y) > P(X), where > is the strict partial order.

But perhaps, it's more accurate to think in terms of the dominance chain. Each X must have a Y that is strictly greater than X in all components.

So let's model each element as a node in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where edges point from X to Y if Y is strictly more preferred than X.

In this DAG, for X to have a dominator Y, there should be a path from Y to X.

But for our problem, we don't need the DAG; we just need to know whether for every X, there is a Y such that X dominates Y.

In other words, in the DAG, every node X has an incoming edge from some Y, meaning that Y can dominate X.

So our problem is to verify that for every element X in any of the prohibited supports, there's an element Y in some permissible support that dominates X, i.e., Y is in a permissible support, and for all C in X's support: C is in Y's support and is strictly preferable to C.

But since the permissible support must dominate the prohibited in all elements, perhaps the way to model it is as follows:

Each permissible support can be thought of as a set, and each prohibited as another set.

We need to ensure that for the set of prohibitive elements, each can be 'covered' by some permissible set, such that the permissible set's elements are all strictly preferred in each position.

So to break it down:

For all prohibitive supports:

   For each of their elements (X):

      There exists a permissible element (Y) such that for all other elements (C) in X, C < Y (in terms of preference).

Thus, Y is a candidate for dominating X.

If for any X, such a Y doesn't exist, then the overall condition is not met, and access isn't granted.

So now, the question is: How do we model the permissible and prohibitive sets in such a way that we can efficiently check for the existence of such Y's?

An approach could be to model each permissible support as a collection of elements and their preferred order, and similarly for prohibitive.

Then, for a given X in prohibitive, check if any Y in any permissible support dominates it.

But this could be computationally heavy if done naively, especially since the number of elements could be large.

But given that the input is manageable, perhaps a straightforward approach is feasible.

So here's the plan:

1) Parse the input into:

   a) Overall logic (condition for access).

   b) Supports of permutations.

   c) Prohibition support.

   d) Preferences between elements.

2) For each prohibited element X:

   Check if any permissible element Y exists such that all elements in X are strictly dominated in Y.

3) If all X have such Y, access granted; else, denied.

But to implement this, we'll need:

- A way to represent each permissible and prohibited support as sets of elements.

- A mapping from elements to their preferred element, to quickly determine if a Y exists that dominates an X.

- For efficiency, perhaps precompute for each Y which X's it can dominate.

But let's proceed.

First, let's parse the input.

### Output:";1660;249;"

### Structured Format with Explanation

**1. Decision Rule:**
Access is granted based on the condition that for each supporting role of a prohibitive condition, there must exist a corresponding supporting permission whose support strictly dominates the prohibitive support. This means each element in the permission support must be strictly more preferred than the corresponding prohibitive element.

**2. Outcome:**
The decision outcome is that the access to the system has been granted. This is determined by evaluating the dominance conditions between the permission and prohibitive supports.

**3. Relations and Preferences:**
- **Domination Conditions:**
  - The permission support ""list"" (elements: list, list_2) is found to strictly dominate the prohibiting support ""consult"" (element: consult).
  - Additionally, ""list_2"" is strictly dominated by ""list"".
  
- **Preferences Influencing the Decision:**
1. Preferences between roles:
   - The role ""surgeon"" is preferred over ""patient"" due to surgeon being more preferred.
   - Preferences between contexts:
     - The context ""referent-doctor"" holds over ""sample_analysis"" and ""no_anesthesia"".

These preferences and dominance conditions collectively lead to the granting of access.";0.490753173828125;0.13787841796875;0.13787841796875;0.2548828125;0.98388671875;0.060760498046875;0.9760479041916168;22.92;13.7;12.34;14.8;17.62;16.9

        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

```

To get started, I need to break down the problem step by step. Let's start by identifying the key components of the problem.

First, the overall logic is given as an explanation of the condition for access being granted. The condition is based on certain rules that need to be followed.

Next, the supports of the permissions and prohibitions are provided. Each support is a list of elements.

Then, the preferences between the elements are given. These preferences are the reasons why certain elements are preferred over others.

Using this information, we need to determine whether the access should be granted or not.

The decision rule is given in the example, but in our case, it's not provided. We need to derive it.

The outcome is either ""Access granted"" or ""Access denied."" In our example, it was granted.

The relations and Preferences section needs to detail all the reasoning that led to the decision.

Let me think about how to approach this.

We need to model the problem as a logical inference. For each support in the prohibitions, there must be a corresponding permission support that dominates it according to the preferences.

So, the steps would be:

1. Identify all the support elements for each prohibitive support.

For each support (prohibition) in the problem, we have a set of elements (roles, permissions, prohibitions) that are part of that support.

Similarly, for the permissions, each support has elements as well.

The idea is that for each element in the permission support, it must be ""dominated"" by some element from the corresponding support in prohibitions.

""Dominated"" in this context means that the element is strictly better than (i.e., preferred to) the element in question. So, for element x in the permutation support, there should be some element y in the corresponding permutation support of prohibitions such that x is dominated by y.

Wait, no. Wait, the condition is that the permutation's support must dominate the prohibitive's support.

So for each role assignment (support of the prohibition), there must exist a corresponding role assignment in the permissions' support where each role is strictly dominated by the corresponding role in the prohibits' support.

In terms of preferences, each preference is a relation between two elements, indicating that one is preferred over the other.

So to model this, we can represent each element as a node in a graph, and each preference as a directed edge from the preferred element to the less preferred.

But perhaps it's better to model it as a graph where each node represents an element, and edges represent the dominance relations.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a constraint satisfaction problem, where for each prohibited support, we must find a permission support where all its elements are strictly dominated (in terms of preference) by some elements in that permission support.

But let me try to think in terms of steps.

Step 1: Enumerate all supports for prohibitions and permissions.

We have for each of the three prohibitions (support1, support2, support3), each has their own support elements.

For example, for support1 of the first prohibition, the support is the list of roles (or elements) that make up that support. Similarly for each other support.

Same for permissions: for each permission support (like support1 for the first permission), we have its own elements.

So the first thing is to list all the elements in each support.

Then for each permutation support (the prohibited support), we need that for every element in it, there is a corresponding element in some permission support which dominates it.

If this is true for all elements in all permutation supports, then access can be granted.

So let's proceed.

Let's list the supports for each.

For permissions:

support1: list of role assignments.

support2: same, perhaps different roles.

support3: same.

For prohibitions:

Each support1, 2, 3 has its own support.

Once we have these lists, the next step is to check for each perm support, whether for each elem in perm_support, there's a perm_elem in some perm_support such that elem is dominated in perm support by perm_elem.

But how do we model dominance?

Dominance is as per the preference rules. So for two elements x and y, x is considered to dominate y if in the preference graph, x has an edge pointing to y, meaning x is better than y.

But wait, the dominance is in the sense that in the support, each element must be strictly dominated. So each x in permSupport must have some y in a corresponding permSupport where x dominates y.

So perhaps for each forbiddenSupport, we look at each of its elements, and for each, see if there's an element in any of the permSupports where that element is dominated.

If for all forbiddenSupports, all their elements are dominated by some permSupport elements, then it's allowed.

So now, the question is, how to compute this.

I think the approach is as follows:

- For each forbidden support (each forbSupport), get the set F of elements in forbSupport.

- For this forbSupport, check whether there exists for each f in F, an element p in any permSupport such that p dominates f.

- If for all forbSupport and all f in their F, such a p exists, then return access granted.

Otherwise, denied.

Now, the problem is how to represent this in code, but since we're trying to reason it out, let's think about the steps.

So first, list all F for each forbSupport. For example, forbSupport1 has F1 = {f1, f2, f3}, forbSupport2 has F2 = {g1, g2, g3}, and so on.

For the first forbSupport (F1), for each fi in F1, check if any p in the union of permS (all permutation supports) has fi dominated by p.

Similarly for F2, F3, etc.

If all F's satisfy this condition, then yes.

So in our example:

In the first forbidden support, F1 is the elements of support1 (which is the role assignments: doctor, staff, etc.). For each of these elements, we check if there exists in any permutation support a role that strictly dominates them.

For instance, for 'doctor' in the forbidden support's first element, is there a role in a permutation support where doctor dominates it? Looking at the permutation supports:

Looking at the first permutation support's roles: 'south_hospital' and 'east_hospital'.

Wait, perhaps the way to model dominance is to create a directed graph where an edge from x to y means x is preferred (dominated) over y. Then, for a given forbidden support F, each f must have a path to some node in the graph.

But for the sake of time, perhaps let's model the dominance as a partial order, where each edge is a strict preference, and the transitive closure allows us to determine dominance.

But in any case, perhaps for the given example, the logic works as follows.

In the example:

The forbidden support1 has elements: doctor (from south hospital), staff (from east hospital), and drop (from west hospital).

Each of these needs to be dominated in their respective permutation support.

Looking at permutation support1:

roles are doctor (south), emp (east), drop (west).

So for doctor in forbiddenSupport1, does there exist a permutation role in support1 where doctor is dominated? Let's see.

In support1's roles, doctor is from south, and others are from east and west. So doctor is a role assigned to the south hospital.

Is there any role from support1 that has doctor as a role and is strictly more preferred than doctor?

Looking at support1 roles:

doctor, emp, drop.

So doctor is the same as the first role. So in the dominance graph, doctor has edges to emp and drop, since doctor is more preferred.

So any element dominated by doctor would be emp or drop.

Thus, for doctor, it can be dominated by emp (since emp is more preferable to doctor), or by drop (since drop is even more preferable).

So in this case, for forbiddenSupport's doctor element, there are permutation roles (emp and drop) that dominate it.

So that's okay.

Next element: 'staff' (from the same support1).

In the forbidden Support1, the second element is 'staff', which is from the east hospital.

Permutation support1: 'emp' is from east, 'south' is doctor, 'west' is 'drop'.

So for staff, which is 'east' in this support, what permutation roles dominate it?

        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";2974;210;"

### Explanation

The decision to grant access was based on the following structured analysis:

**1. Decision Rule:**
Access is allowed if for every permutation (support) of a prohibited role, there corresponds a permutation (permission) of roles such that each role in the permission strictly dominates the respective support in the prohibited role.

**2. Outcome:**
The access was **granted** because all permutations of prohibited roles were successfully dominated by corresponding permutations of permissions.

**3. Relations and Preferences:**
- **Domination:** Each permutation of prohibitive roles was dominated by its corresponding permission. For instance, the permutation ""Doctor holds"" in the South_Hospital role was strictly preferred over the East_Hospital employee role.
- **Context Preferences:** Context-related preferences were considered, with contexts like ""Emergency holds"" being more preferred than ""Sample Analysis holds."" These context preferences were used to ensure the dominance conditions were met.

**Conclusion:**
Since all permutations were dominated by their corresponding permissions and contexts were appropriately handled, access was successfully granted.";0.585798814561632;0.38458251953125;0.2679070366753472;0.314697265625;0.98876953125;0.0269622802734375;1.0;18.05;15.5;14.99;17.4;18.97;19.6

### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

```

To get started, I need to figure out how to model the problem using the given logic and input. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll try to understand the problem statement.

The problem is about determining whether access to a system is granted based on certain conditions related to permissions and prohibitions. The logic given in the example explains how the decision is made.

Let me look at the input provided. The input includes the overall logic, the supports of permissions, supports of prohibitions, and the preferences between the elements.

In the example input, the 'Overall Logic' section explains the condition for access being granted. It says that for access to be granted, each support (permission) of a prohibition must have a corresponding permission support that dominates the prohibition's support.

Dominance is defined as each element in the permission support being strictly preferred (according to the given preferences) to some element in prohibitions support.

The 'Relation and Preferences' section lists several relations, each with a reason. For example, ""The relation 'The organisation ... employes ...' is preferred over 'the organisation ...' because 'nurse' is better than 'medical_secretary'.""

So, the task is to apply this logic to the provided input and explain why the access is or isn't granted.

Now, the input is structured as follows:

1. Overall Logic:
   - Access granted if for each prohibition support, there's a permission support where permission support dominates.
   - Dominance: Each element in permission support is > (strictly preferred) to an element in prohibiting support.
   
2. Supports of Permission:
   Several supports for permissions. Each is a list of elements (e.g., 'The organization ... grant the role ... Permission ... if ... context ... holds ...').

3. Similar for Prohibitions.

4. Preferences Between Elements:
   A list of relations and their reasons. Each relation indicates which preference is stronger.

So, to model this, I think we need to:

- For each prohibitive support, find if there's any permission support whose support dominates it.
- If for all prohibitive supports, such a dominating permission support exists, then access is allowed.
- Otherwise, it's denied.

But how do we model the dominance? We need a way to compare the support elements according to the preferences.

I think we can represent each support as a set of elements, and for each element, have a ranking. Then, when comparing two elements, we can determine which is preferred based on their rankings.

Alternatively, perhaps we can create a dictionary that maps each element to its preference level, and then for any two elements in a support, compare their levels to see which is higher.

Wait, but the preferences are given as relations. So, for example, 'R1' is a relation between element A and B, and it's preferred over another relation 'R2' between C and D.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to build a data structure that allows us to compare elements based on the given relations.

Each element can be assigned a 'preference rank' based on how it compares to other elements.

For example, if 'A' is ranked higher than 'B', then in any comparison, A would be preferred over B.

We can represent this as a dictionary where each element is a key, and its value is the rank.

Then, for two elements x and y, we compare their ranks:

- If x's rank is higher than y's, then x is preferred.
- Else, y is preferred.

But wait, the relations are given in terms of which one is preferred. So for example:

- 'R' is the relation where 'x' > 'y' (x is preferred).
- 'S' is another relation, say 'y > z' (y is preferred).

So, for any x and z, to determine the order, we have to chain these relations.

This seems similar to topological sorting, where each relation defines a partial order, and we can compute the overall order.

Thus, perhaps the approach is:

- Assign a rank to each element based on its preferences.
- For any element x, the rank is the sum of the ranks of the relations that lead to it, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each relation can be thought of as a directed edge in a graph, where an edge from x to y indicates that x is more preferred than y.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline the steps.

1. Collect all unique elements from the permission and prohibits.

2. For each relation, create a mapping from element A to element B, indicating that A is preferred (i.e., A > B).

3. Build a graph where each node is an element, and each directed edge from A to B indicates that A should come before B in the order.

   Wait, but how? Because the relations define the preferences, which are transitive.

   So, perhaps for each relation 'A > B', we add an edge A → B, meaning A comes before B.

   Then, the topological order of this graph will give us the order in which elements are preferred.

   However, in our case, the dominance condition is that for each permission support's element, it must be strictly preferred over some element of prohibits support.

   But perhaps the key is to model each element's rank, so that we can compare two elements and determine which has a higher rank.

   Once we have the ranks for all elements, comparing any two can be done by comparing their ranks.

   For example:

   - If rank(x) > rank(y), then x > y.

   Now, for a dominance condition, we need for each x in prohibits_support, to find a y in permissions_support such that y > x.

   Therefore, the steps would be:

   a. Compute the rank of each element.

   b. For every support in the prohibitions:

      i. Check if any support in permissions dominates it.

      ii. If such a support exists for all, proceed; else, deny access.

   To compute the ranks, perhaps using a topological sort approach on the graph.

   Alternatively, since the relations form a directed acyclic graph (because each relation is a strict preference and there are no cycles), we can assign a rank by processing each node and propagating the rank through the edges.

   Let me think of an example.

   Suppose we have elements A, B, C, D.

   Relations:

   A > C

   C > B

   B > D

   So the graph would have edges A→C, C→B, B→D.

   Topological order would be A, then C, then B, then D. So each node's rank would be higher than the next.

   If we assign rank 1 to D (since it's the last), then B has rank 2, C rank 3, A rank 4.

   This way, any relation in the graph can be used to compute the rank for each node.

   Thus, the plan is:

   For all relations, build a directed graph where A→B means A is better (preferred) over B. Then perform a topologically sorted order, assigning each node a rank such that for any edge, the source has a lower rank than the destination.

   With this rank assignment, any comparison between two elements can be determined by their ranks: if rank(A) < rank(B), then A < B (A is worse than B).

   So now, for the given input, I can process each relation and build the graph, then perform topological ordering to assign ranks. Then for each prohibited support, check if any of its elements is dominated by any of the permissions supports.

   Also, note that if any element in a prohibited support cannot be dominated by the permissions support, then the overall condition is not met, and access is denied.

   Additionally, if the same element appears in both a permission and a prohibit, it doesn't affect the condition, as dominance requires different elements.

   Another point to consider is that the dominance is element-wise. So even if one element is dominated, but another is not, the condition is still not met.

   Finally, we also need to make sure that we process all relations to build the correct graph and assign the ranks correctly.

   Putting it all together, here's how I can approach the solution:

   Step 1: Extract all elements from both permission and prohibits supports. Also, collect all preferences (from the 'Preferences Between Elements' section) to create the directed graph.

Step 2: For each preference relation, add a";0.4569610595703125;0.1427001953125;0.1411895751953125;0.146240234375;0.97607421875;0.12139892578125;0.9691535150645624;56.25;9.1;7.98;12.2;8.52;8.9

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

### Output:";3346;332;"

### Explanation:

**Decision Rule:**
Access is granted based on the condition that for every element of a prohibited support, there must exist a corresponding element in a permissible support where the permissible support strictly dominates the prohibited support.

**Outcome:**
The access is denied because the logic did not satisfy the dominance condition for all prohibited supports.

**Relations andPreferences:**
- For the support 1 of the prohibitions, the relation ""The context south_hel holds"" is preferred over the context north_hel hold.
- The support 3 of the prohibits is dominated by the permission support 2 of the permissible.
- Additionally, the relations ""The organization east-hospital employs Victor-Turner"" are preferred over ""the organization south-hospital employee.""
- The relations ""the context afternoon hold"" are not preferred over other relations.
- All these relations and their preferences were considered in determining the decision.

**Conclusion:**
Since the dominance conditions were not fully satisfied, access was denied.

**Answer:**
Here is the structured explanation of the reasoning process:

1. The decision rule is based on whether each prohibited support has a corresponding permissible support that strictly dominates it.
2. The outcome is a denial of access, as the conditions for dominance were not met.
3. The reasoning includes the following:
   - The context south-hel holds was preferred over context north-hel hold, contributing to the denial.
   - Domination conditions for specific prohibitions were not satisfied, leading to the conclusion of access denial.

Thus, the final decision was to deny access due to the failure to meet the dominance criteria across all prohibited and corresponding permissible supports.";0.5580530802408854;0.3510589599609375;0.26858266194661456;0.2054443359375;0.9853515625;0.020172119140625;0.9766536964980544;28.03;13.8;12.26;16.0;15.54;15.8

### Example Input
        1. **Overall Logic:** Explain the condition under which access is granted. An access is granted if and only if, for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's. Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition. Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 
        2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role secondee the Permission to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context secondment holds,The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1,  
        3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
        (support 1): The organization consortium grants the role staff_member the Prohibition to perform the activity modify on the view secondment_reports if the context default holds,The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity, The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports, The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium,  
        4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
        The relation ``The organisation university1 employes Bob in the role secondee, `` is preferred to ``The organisation consortium employes Bob in the role staff_member, `` because: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        The relation ``The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1, `` is preferred to ``The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium, `` because: secondment is preferred to default. 
        **The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Bob to perform edit on report1 is granted. 
### Example Output
        Here is an example of an explanation:
        **Decision Rule:** 
        Access is granted if and only if, for every support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support of a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Dominance means that each element of the permission's support is strictly preferred to at least one element of the prohibition's support. 
        **Outcome:** 
        The access is granted because the permission's support dominates the prohibition's support. Specifically: 
        The permission's support contains elements that are strictly preferred to corresponding elements in the prohibition's support. 
        Both dominance conditions (role preference and context preference) are satisfied. 
        **Relations and Preferences**: 
        Permission Support Elements: 
        Role Assignment: The organisation university1 employs Bob in the role secondee. → Preferred over the prohibition's role assignment: The organisation consortium employs Bob in the role staff_member. 
        Reason: secondee is preferred to staff_member. 
        Context: The context secondment holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation university1. → Preferred over the prohibition's context: The context default holds between Bob, edit, and report1 in the organisation consortium.
        Reason: secondment is preferred to default.
        Other Elements (No Preference Needed): 
        Both permission and prohibition share: 
        The organisation consortium considers edit as a modify activity. 
        The organisation consortium uses report1 in the view secondment_reports. 
        Since these are identical, no preference comparison is required. 
        Conclusion: Since all elements of the permission's support are either preferred to or match the prohibition's support, access is granted.

An access is granted if and only if,         for each support of a prohibition, there exists a corresponding support for a permission where the permission's support dominates the prohibition's.         Dominance means that: each element of the support of the permission is strictly preferred to at least one element of the support of the prohibition.         Here are the different elements which compose the decision: 2. **Supports of Permission:** List of the elements that compose the permission supports: 
(support 1): The organization east_hospital grants the role intern the Permission to perform the activity handle on the view sample if the context emergency holds,The organisation east_hospital employes Grace_Davis in the role intern, The organisation central_hospital considers delegate as a handle activity, The organisation east_hospital uses patinet_admin_data_1 in the view sample, The context emergency holds between Grace_Davis, delegate, and patinet_admin_data_1 in the organisation east_hospital,  
3. **Supports of Prohibition:** List of the elements composing the prohibition support: 
(support 1): The organization west_hospital grants the role patient the Prohibition to perform the activity handle on the view medical_data if the context afternoon holds,The organisation west_hospital employes Grace_Davis in the role patient, The organisation central_hospital considers delegate as a handle activity, The organisation west_hospital uses patinet_admin_data_1 in the view medical_data, The context afternoon holds between Grace_Davis, delegate, and patinet_admin_data_1 in the organisation west_hospital,

4. **Preferences Between the Elements:** 
The relation ``The organisation east_hospital employes Grace_Davis in the role intern, `` is preferred to ``The organisation west_hospital employes Grace_Davis in the role patient, `` because: intern is preferred to patient. 
The relation ``The context emergency holds between Grace_Davis, delegate, and patinet_admin_data_1 in the organisation east_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context afternoon holds between Grace_Davis, delegate, and patinet_admin_data_1 in the organisation west_hospital, `` because: emergency is preferred to afternoon. 
The relation ``The organisation east_hospital employes Grace_Davis in the role intern, `` is preferred to ``The organisation south_hospital employes Grace_Davis in the role student, `` because: intern is preferred to student. 
The relation ``The context emergency holds between Grace_Davis, delegate, and patinet_admin_data_1 in the organisation east_hospital, `` is preferred to ``The context afternoon holds between Grace_Davis, delegate, and patinet_admin_data_1 in the organisation south_hospital, `` because: emergency is preferred to afternoon. 
**The Decision:** The outcome of the logical inference is: the permission for Grace_Davis to perform delegate on patinet_admin_data_1 is granted. 
### **Request for Explanation:** Using the provided logic, supports, and preferences.             Please explain the decision-making process (why the access was granted or denied). Please use the structured format below:
 1. **Decision Rule**: [Provide the decision rule used for the decision-making process.]
 2. **Outcome**: [Describe the decision outcome clearly and concisely.]
 3. **Relations and Preferences**: [Explain the different relations and preferences that influenced the decision. Include all relevant information.]
 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.

### Output:";1654;281;"

### Structured Output:
**1. Decision Rule:**  
Access is granted based on the condition that for each *support* of a *prohibition*, there must exist a *corresponding support* for a *permission* where the *permission's support* dominates the * prohibiton's support*. Dominance is defined as each element in the * permutation* of the * permission* being * strictly preferred* to or matches the * prohibition's* support.

**2. Outcome:**  
The outcome is that the access for the permission 'Grace_Davis' to perform 'delegate' on 'pat.net' is granted due to the dominance condition being satisfied.

**3. Relations and Preferences:**  
- The relation ""The organization east-hospital employee Grace-Davis ..."" is preferred over ""the organization west-hospital patient ..."" because ""intern"" is considered ""preferred"" to ""patient.""
- The context ""emergency holds"" between ""Grace-Davis"", ""delegate"", and ""pat.net"" in ""east-hospital"" is found to be preferred over the context ""afternoon holds"" in the ""south-hospital.""
- Additionally, the preference chain is such that ""intermediate steps"" are considered, with each relation contributing to the overall dominance condition.
- The conclusion is reached after analyzing all relations and their respective preferences, ensuring that the dominance conditions are met for all prohibitions.";0.63450927734375;0.2618408203125;0.2618408203125;0.76806640625;0.970703125;0.08990478515625;0.9731182795698925;31.38;12.5;13.16;14.7;16.29;16.5
