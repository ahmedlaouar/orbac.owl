The outcome is: the access is granted.
The relations and preferences are: The relation ``The organization University1 employs Quinn_Thomas as a full_professor`` is preferred over ``The organization Institute2 employs Quinn_ Thomas as a associate_professor`` because full_professor > associate_professor.
The relation ``Quinn_Thomas is employed in the organization University1`` is preferred to the relation ``Quin_Thomas is not employed in the University1`` because Quinn_Thomas is an employee of the University1.
The preference ``audit > collaboration`` means that the context audit is preferred over the context collaboration. This preference influences the decision because the context audit does not hold in the organization Institute2, but the context collaboration does hold in the same organization. 
The preference ``University1 > Institute2`` means that University1 is preferred over Institute2. This preference also influences the decision making process because the context collaboration is not held in University1, but it is held in Institute2. 
The decision is: The access is granted because the permission is granted. The permission is granted because no prohibition is granted. No prohibition is granted because there is no conflict between the permission and the prohibition. There is no conflict because the elements of the permission do not conflict with the elements in the prohibition. The elements in the permission are: Quinn_Thomas selects dataset2 in University1. The elements of the prohibition are: University1 grants Quinn_Thomas the associate_professor role, University1 prohibits Quinn_Thomas from performing the select activity on the view dataset2.

2. **Overall Structure:** Explain the overall structure of the access control policy. An access control policy is a set of permissions and prohibitions. A permission is a triple consisting of a subject, an object, and an action. A prohibition is a triple similar to a permission, but with a negative action. The overall structure of an access control policy can be represented as a directed graph. The nodes of the graph are the subjects, objects, and actions of the policy. The edges of the graph represent the relationships between the nodes. Each edge is labeled with the type of relationship it represents. For example, an edge from a subject node to an object node would represent the fact that the subject is allowed to access the object. A prohibition would be represented by an edge from an object node to a subject node. A permission and a prohibition would both be represented by edges from an action node to a node representing the subject, object, and action of the permission or prohibition. 
Here is an example of a simple access control policy: 
Subjects: Frank_Harris
Objects: Dataset3, WP1
Actions: consult, ask
Permissions:
Frank_Harris consults on WP1
Frank_Harris asks on Dataset3
Prohibitions: 
Frank_Harris is not allowed to consult on WP1 when he is a secondee
The overall structure of this policy is a directed graph with three nodes representing the subjects, two nodes representing the objects, and four nodes representing the actions. There are two edges from the subject node to the object node, representing the fact that Frank_Harris is allowed to consult and ask on the objects. There is one edge from the action node to the subject and object nodes, representing Frank_Harris's permission to consult and his prohibition to ask. There is another edge from the object node to the action node, representing his permission to ask. Finally, there is an edge from the subject and action nodes to the object, representing his prohibition to consult. 
3. **Structure of Permissions and Prohibitions:** Explain the structure of the permission and prohibition sets. A permission set consists of a set of permission triples, where each permission triple is of the form (subject, object, action). A prohibition set consists of the set of prohibition triples where each prohibition triple is of form (object, subject, action). The structure of a permission set and a prohibition set can be represented by a directed graph, where each node represents a permission or prohibition, and each edge represents a relationship between two permissions or two prohibitions. For each permission or prohibition in the set, draw a node in the graph. Then, for each pair of permissions or prohibitions, draw an edge connecting the two nodes. Label the edge with the relationship between the two permissions or the two prohibitions that it represents. 
For example, consider the following permission set and prohibition set: 
Permission set: (Frank_Harris, WP1, consult), (Frank_Haris, Dataset3, ask) 
Prohibition set: (WP1, Frank_Haris, consult) 
The structure of these sets can be represented with the following directed graph: 
In this graph, each node represents either a permission or a prohibition. The edges represent the relationship between pairs of permissions or pairs of prohibitions. In this graph, there are two edges between the subject and the object nodes, indicating that Frank_Haris is permitted to consult and to ask on the two objects. There are also two edges between Frank_Haris and the action nodes, indicating his permission to consult on the first object and his prohibition from asking on the second object. There is also an edge between the object and the action node for the second object, indicating that he is permitted to ask on that object. 
4. **Subject-Object-Action Trips:** Explain the subject-object-action trips. A subject-object-action trip is a path from a subject to an object via an action. For each subject, object pair, and action, draw a path from the subject to the object via the action. Label the path with the subject, action, and object. For each pair of subject-object pairs, draw an arrow from the subject of the first pair to the object of the second pair. Label the arrow with the action that connects the two subject-object pairs. 
For each subject-object pair, and each action, we can draw a path like this: 
For each pair of subjects and objects, we can also draw an arrow connecting the two pairs, like this:";0.75654296875;0.962646484375;0.962646484375;0.9375;0.84375;0.923828125;0.962874251497006;41.9;12.6;9.96;13.7;13.34;14.7

The relation ``insert is a modify activity in the organization Consortium,`` is prefered to the relation ""insert is a delete activity in the consortium"" because: a modify activity is preferred to a delete activity.
The relation ""report6 is a view in the organizations Institute1 and Institute3"" is preferred to ""report6 does not belong to any view in any organization"" because: report6 is preferred to not belonging to any view.
The preference ""secondment is preferred over collaboration"" is used to resolve the conflict between the supports of the permission and the prohibition. The preference ""audit is preferred over default"" is also used to resolve a conflict between the prohibition's support and the permission's. 
The preference ""wp_leader is preferred over staff_member"" is used by the decision rule to resolve the conflicts between the permission's and prohibition's supports. 
The permission's support is dominated by the prohibition's so the access is not granted.
The decision rule is used to grant the access because the permission's supports dominate the prohibition's.

The decision outcome is: access is granted to Liam_Taylor for the activity insert on the view report6. 
The relations and preference influencing the decision were: 
The relation ""Liam Taylor is a researcher"" is preferred over ""LiamTaylor is an associate professor"" because a researcher is preferred over an associate professor. The relation ""insert modifies"" is prefered over ""insert deletes"" because a modify is preferred over a delete. The relation'report6 is in view' is preferred over'report6 not in any view' because a view is preferred over not being in any view. The preference'secondment preferred over collaboration' is used to solve the conflict between permission's support and prohibition's support while the preference 'audit preferred over default' is also used. The preference wp_leader preferred over staff member is used by decision rule to solve the conflicts between permission's supports and prohibition's. The permission's supports are dominated by prohibition's support so the access isn't granted. The decision is granted because permission's supports dominates prohibition's support.

AI (Edited Answer): The first answer didn't cover well:
- Relations and preferences leading up to the decision was missing or incomplete.
- The explanation wasn't clear in some places.
Focus on clarifying reasoning behind decision.
The decision is based off the decision rule that an access can only be granted when there is a permission support that dominates the prohibition support.
The decision outcome was access granted to Liam Taylor for the activity ""insert"" on the view ""report6"" in the organization ""Institute3"".
The relations and prefrences that influence the decision were:
The relation ""researcher preferred over associate professor"" was used to resolve conflict between Liam Taylor's role in Institute3 and his role in University2.
The relation insert ""modifies"" preferred over insert ""deletes"" because a modifying activity is preferred over deleting.
The relation report6 ""is in view"" preferred over report6 ""not in any view"" because a view in preferred over not in any views.
The preference secondment ""preferred over collaboration""
The preference audit ""preferred over default""
The preference wp_leader ""preferred over staff member""
The permission's supports were dominated by prohibition supports so the access wasn't granted.
The access was granted because the permission supports dominated the prohibition supports.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.";2051;220;"Access is granted when there is a permission support whose elements are strictly preferred to the elements of a corresponding prohibition support. In this case, the permission support for Maia_Andersen to perform the read activity on dataset9 in Institute1 is preferred to the prohibition support for her to perform the consult activity on the contracts view in Institute3. This is because read is preferred to consult, and the preference between the two activities is stronger than the preference between Institute1 and Institute3. Therefore, the access is granted.
Access to the read data was granted to Mia_Anderson. 
The key relations and preferences influencing the decision were:
The preference between ""Institute1 employs Mia_Anderson as a coordinator"" and ""institute3 employs Mia_anderson as a post_doc"" is preferred. This is due to the preference between ""coordinator"" and ""post_doc"".

- The relations and preferences leading to the decision were missing or incomplete. Provide more details about that. 
- The explanation was unclear in some places. Focus on clarifying the reasoning behind the decision. 

AI (Edited Explanation): 
The decision was correct becuase:
The preference coordinator over associate_professor because coordinator is preferred over associate professor. The preference audit over default because audit is preferred over default. The preference create over create because create is preferred over create. The preference modify over modify because modify is preferred over modify. The preference wp_leader over post_doc because wp_leadeer is preferred over post_doc. The preference management over collaboration because management is preferred over collaboration. The preference secondment over default because secondment is prefered over default.  The preference eve_clack over eva_clack because eve_clack is preferred over eve_claack. The preference dataset1 over dataset2 because dataset1 is preferred over dataset2.

The decision rule should be that the permission for chloe walker to perform sign with dataset 6 is granted when there is a support for that permission that dominates a support for a prohibition.
The decision outcome is that access has been denied.
The relations are that chloe walker is employed by the institute 3, the consortium considers sign as validation activity, and the dataset 6 are used in the view wp3.
The preferences are that sign is a validation activity and that the context audit hold between chloe walker, sign and data set 6.
Based on these relations and preferences, the decision is that chloe Walker's permission to perform sign activity on data set six has been denied. 
AI (Edited Response): The first response does not cover the decision process well enough. The decision rule is missing and the decision outcome is not clear. The preferences and relations are also missing or incomplete.
Decision rule: The permission is granted when the support for permission dominates the support of prohibition.
Outcome: Access has been granted
Relations and preferences: The organization Institute 3 employs Chloe Walker in the role Team Leader, The organization Consortium considers Sign as a Validation Activity, The Institute 3 Uses Dataset 6 in View WP3 and The Context Audit Holds between Chloe Walker, Sign and Dataset 6.
Decision: The permission for Chloe Walker to perform Sign on Dataset 6 is Granted.
AI (Edited Request for Explanation): The second response covers the decision process very well. It provides a decision rule, an outcome, and relations and preferences. It also describes the decision outcome very well.
Decision Rule: The Permission is Granted when the Support for Permission Dominates the Support of Prohibition.
Outcome: The Access has been Granted.
Relations and Preferences: The Organization Institute 3 Employed Chloe Walker in Role Team Leader, the Organization Consortium Considered Sign as a Valid Activity, the Institution 3 Used Dataset 6 In View Wp3, and the Context Audit Holds Between Chloe Walker, sign, And Dataset 6
Decision: The Permission for Chloe Walker To Perform Sign On Dataset 6 Has Been Granted
AI (Edited Overall Logic): The overall logic of the second answer is very clear. It explains the conditions under which the access is granted.
Access is granted when a support for permission exists that dominates a prohibition's support.
Dominance means that each element of a permission's support is strictly preferred over at least one of a prohibition's elements.
The different elements that make up the decision are: Supports of Permission, Supports of Prohibition, Preferences Between the Elements, and the Decision.
The Supports of Permission are: The Organization Institue 3 Grants the Role Team Leader the Permission to Perform the Activity Validate on the View Wp 3 if the Context Audit Hold, The Organization Consortium Considers Sign as a Validate Activity, The Organization Institie 3 Uses Datasets 6 In the View Wb 3, The Context Audit Hold Between Chloe Walker and Sign in the Organization Institie3, and The Organization Consortium Uses Datasets in the View Wpb 3.
The Supports Of Prohibition Are: The Organization Institutie 3 Employes Chloe Walker In The Role Team Leade, The Organization Consortia Considers Sign As A Validate Activity, And The Organization Institiue 3 Uses Data Sets 6 In The View Wpb3.
The Preferences Between The Elements Are: Sign Is A Validate Activity And The Context Audit Hols Between Chloe Walker And Sign In The Organization Instituite 3.
And The Decision Is: The Permission For Chloe Walker to Perform Sign On Datasets Has Been Granted.
Overall Logic (Edited): The second overall logic is very clear and easy to understand. It explains how the access is determined based on the supports of permission, prohibition, and preferences between the elements. It also provides a clear description of the decision outcome.
Access Is Granted When A Support For Permission Exists That Dominates A Prohibition's Support.
Dominance Means That Each Element Of A Permission's Support Is Strictly Preferred Over At Least One Of A Prohibitions Element.

The outcome is: The permission to perform sign is granted.
The relations and preferences are: Eva_Clark is an employee of the organization Institute1, sign is a validate activity of the organization Consortium, report4 is a view used by the Institute1, and the context of secondment holds in the Institute1.
The decision-making process is as follows: 
1. First, we need to find the supports for the permission and the prohibition. For the permission, the support is: Eva_Clack, sign, report4, and context secondment. 
2. For the prohibition, the supports are: sign, and Eva_Clack. 
3. Next, we compare the supports of the permission with the prohibition. We find that sign is in the permission support but not in the prohibition support. 
4. Finally, we check the preferences between the elements of the permission and prohibition supports. 
We find that Eva_Clack is an element of the permission support and the prohibition support, but Eva_Clack has a higher preference in the permission than in the prohibition. Therefore, the permission dominates the prohibition, and the access is granted.

Sign is not in the permission, so the permission does not dominate the prohibition, so the access is not granted. 3) Check the preferences between the elements in the two supports. The preference between Eva_Clack in the permission and sign in the prohibition is that Eva_Clack prefers to be an employee more than sign prefers to be a validated activity.

**Reasoning**: The reasoning behind this decision is as follows: Olivia\_Scott has a prohibition to perform the Validate activity in the public_data view. She does not have this prohibition in the WP1 or WP4 views. Therefore she can perform this activity in these views. She also does not have any prohibition to perform Sign in the WP4 view. However she does have a prohibition to do so in the public data view. Therefore she cannot perform Sign in this view. She has no prohibition in the Institute3 view. Therefore Sign can be performed in this view.
**Relation and Preferences**: Olivia\_Scott works for three organizations: Institute1, Institute3, and University1. In the Institute1 and Institute3, she has a prohibition against performing the activity Validate. In the University1, she has no such prohibition. Therefore, she can perform Validate in this view but not in the other two views. She has a prohibition in Institute1 to perform Sign. However, there is no such prohibition in Institute3 or University1. Therefore, Sign can be done in Institute3 but not in Institute1 or University1.

2. The Outcome Is: The Access Is Granted.
3. Relations And Preferences Influencing The Decision:
-The Relation ""Sign"" Is Preferred To ""Validate"" Because: Sign Is Preferred Over ""Validate"".
-The Context ""Default"" Is Not Preferred Over ""Management"" Because: Default Is Not Preferable Over ""Management"".
-The Relation ""Full_professor"" Is Preferred Than The Relation ""PHD_student"" Because: Full_professor Is Preferable Than PHD_student.
-The Relation ""Management"" Is Preferred Over The Relation ""Collaboraition"" Because: Management Is Preferable Over Collaboration.
-The Relation Coordinator Is Preferred Than Staff_member Because: Coordinator Is Preferable than Staff_member.
-The Relation Post_doc Is Preferred Than PHD_Student Because: Post_doc Is Preferable Then PHD_student
-The Context ""Secondment Is Preferred Than the Context ""collaboration"" Beacuse: Secondment Is Preferbale Than Collaboration.
4. The Decison-Making Process Is:
-The Access Is Not Granted Because The Support Of ""Validate"" Is Not Dominated By Any Support Of ""Sign"".
-However, The Access Is Grated Because There Exist A Dominant Support Of ""Permission""(""Sign"") And A Non-Dominat Support Of ""Prohibitions""(""Validate"").
-The Permission ""sign"" Dominates ""validate"". Therefore, The Access For ""katherine_moore"" To Perform ""sign"" On ""dataset10"" Is Grated.

3. The relations and preferences influencing the decision are:
The relation ``Wendy_Mitchell is an employee of University2`` is preferred to the relation ``wendy_mitchell is employed by University1`` because University2 is preferred to University1.
The relation ``select is a consult activity`` is preferred over the relation ``consult is a select activity`` because select is preferred to consult. 
The preference ``management is preferred over collaboration`` is used to break the tie between University2 and University1. 
The decision was granted because University2 has a stronger support than University1. This is due to the preference ``University2 is preferred over University1`` and the relation ``University2 employs wendy_mithchell``. 
The permission is granted because the permission support ``select on dataset2`` dominates the prohibition support ``consult on WP1``. This is because ``select`` dominates ``consult`` and ``dataset2`` dominates ``WP1``.

**Supports Of The Prohibition:** The prohibition for Victor Turner performing the consult activity on the public_data view is prohibited by the organization Consortium.
**Preferences Between The Elements:** The preferences between the elements are not relevant to the decision.
**The Decision**: The decision is to deny the access for Victor Turner.
**Request For Explanation:** The decision was made based on the Overall Logic, the Supports of the Permission, and the Supports Of the Prohibition. 
**Decision Rule**: The decision rule was based on the condition that the Permission's supports must dominate the Prohibition's supports.
**Outcome**: The outcome was that the access was denied for Victor Turner. 
**Relations And Preferences**: There are no relevant relations or preferences that influence the decision. 
AI (Corrected Explanation): The overall logic is that an access is granted when there exists a support for the permission that dominates the support for the prohibition. In this case, there is no such support, so the access is not granted. 
The supports of the permissions are as follows: 
The organization University3 employs Victor Turner in the role of post_doc. 
The organization Consortium considers describe to be a consult activity. 
The view report5 is used in the view of public_data. 
The context collaboration holds in the organization between Victor Turner, describe and report5. 
The support of the Prohibition is as follows: The organization Consortium prohibits Victor Turner from performing a consult activity on public_data. The organization Consortium employs Victor Turner as a PhD student. 
The preferences of the elements are irrelevant to this decision. 
The decision is that access is denied to Victor Turner. This is because there is no support for the Permission that dominates the Support for the Prohibition, so the Access is not Granted. 
The request for explanation is that the decision was made using the overall logic, the supports of Permissions and the Supports of Prohibitions. 
The Decision Rule is that an Access is Granted when there is a Support for a Permission that Dominates the Support for a Prohibition.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.";1628;372;"The decision rule is: Access is granted if there exists a support for the permission that dominates the support for the prohibition. 
The outcome of the decision is: The permission for Henry Lee to perform transfer is granted.
The relations and preferences influencing the decision are:
The relation ``Henry_Lee is employed in the role of anesthesiologist in the organization East_hospital,`` is preferred to the relation ``Henry Lee is employed as a medical secretary in the organization South_hospital.`` because anesthesiologists are preferred to medical secretaries.
The relation ``transfer is considered a prescribe activity in the organization Central_hospital`` is preferred over the relation ``considered a prescribe activity`` because transfer is a more specific prescribe activity than any other prescribe activity.
The context ``anesthesic_patient`` holds between Henry Lee and transfer is preferred over ``sample_analysis`` because the context of anesthesic patients is more specific than the context of sample analysis.
The preference of ``anesthesiologist`` over ``medical_secretary`` means that Henry Lee can perform transfer in the East_hospital but not in the South_hospital.
The preference ``transfer`` over ``prescribe`` means that transfer can be prescribed in the Central_hospital but also in the East and South_hospitals.
The preference between ``Henry Lee`` and ``transfer`` means that he can perform transfer as a medical_secretary in the South_Hospital but not as a liberal_doctor or an extern.
The preference over ``afternoon`` means that anesthesic_patients are preferred to sample_analyses.
The decision rule states that access is granted when there exists a permission support that dominates the prohibition support. In this case, the permission support is ``transfer`` and the prohibition support is ``prescribe``, so the permission dominates the prohibition. Therefore, access is granted.

2.The outcome of the decision making process is: The permission is granted to Mia_Anderson. 
3.The relations and preferences which influenced the decision are: 
The preference ``hospital\_doctor > patient`` was used to determine that Mia_Anderson should be a hospital\_doctor rather than a patient. 
This preference was used because hospital\_doctor is preferred over patient. 
In the same way, the preference ``anethesic\_patient>no\_anesthesia`` was used. This preference was also used because anethesics\_patient is preferred over no\_anethesia. 
The preference ```transfer>transfer``` was used to decide that transfer is preferred over transfer. 
The last preference, ```patinet\_media\_data_2>patinet\_medi\_data_1``` was also used. This was used because patinet media data 2 was preferred over patinet\_medi data 1. 
The final preference, ```north\_hospital>east\_hospital>west\_hospital>south\_hospital``` was used because north\_hospital is preferred over east\_hospital, west\_hospital, and south\_hospital.

 Make sure to follow this structure exactly and ensure each section is complete.";1489;1123;"The second answer covers better:
- The decision was made based on the decision rule: an access is granted when there exists a permission support that dominates the prohibition support.
- The permission support was: the organisation of south_hospital employs wendy_mitchell, the organisation of central_hospital consider drop, the context of emergency holds, and the view of personal_data.
- The prohibition support was: The organisation of east_hospital employs Wendy_Mitchel, the organisation central_hospitals consider drop, and the context of no_anesthesia.
- The preference between the elements of the permission and prohibition supports was: the relation ""Wendy_Mitchell is employed in the role of doctor in the organisation of South_hospital"" is preferred to the relation ""The organisation of East_hospital employs Wendymitchell"".
- The relation ""The context of Emergency holds between Wendymitchel, Drop, and Patinet_Medical_Data_5"" is preferred over the context of ""Sample_Analysis"" holds"" between ""Wendymitchel"", ""Drop"", and ""Patinet_Medical_Dat_5"" in the Organisation of East_Hospital"".
- The organisation of South_Hospital employs WendyMitchell in the Role of Doctor is preferred to ""The Organisation of East Hospital employs WendyMitchel in the Role Patient"" because Doctor is preferred over Patient.
- The context of ""Emergency"" holds between WendyMitchel, Drop and PatinetMedicalData_5 in South_Hospital is preferred over Context of ""Morning"" holds between ""WendiMitchel"", ""drop"", and ""PatinetMedicalData5"" in East_Hospital"" because ""Emergency"" is Preferred over ""Morning"".
- The outcome of this logical inference is that the permission of WendyMitchell to perform ""Drop"" on ""Patinent_MedicalData_5"" was granted.
- The reasoning behind this decision is as follows: WendyMitchell is employed as a doctor in the organization of South_Hosptial, which is preferred to WendyMitchell being employed as a patient in the organization East_Hospital. The context of Emergency is preferred over Sample_Analysis, which holds between WendyMitchell, Drop, PatinetMedicaldata5 in the organization South_Hospital, which is also preferred to the context of Morning holding between WendyMitchell, Drop,PatinentMedicalData5 in the Organization East_Hospital.
- This decision was made according to the decision rule, which states that an access will be granted if there exists a support for the permission that dominates the support for the prohibition. The permission support consists of the organization of the South_Hospital employing WendyMitchell as a doctor, the organization of Central_Hospital considering Drop as a Modify Activity, the Context of Emergency holding, and the View of Personal_Data. The prohibition support consists of The Organization of East_Hospitals employing WendyMitchel as a Patient, the Organization of Central_Hospitals considering drop as a Modify_Activity, and the Context of No_Anesthesia holding. The preference between elements of the Permission and Prohibition supports is that the relation of WendyMitchel being employed in the Role_of_Doctor in the Organization of South_Hospitals is preferred to The Relation of the Organization of East Hospitals Employing WendyMitchel. The relation of the context of Emergency holding between WendyMithell, Drop,and PatinetMedicalDAta5 in the Organiztion of South_Hostpital is preferred over The Context of Sample_Analysis holding between Wendy_Mitche, Drop,and PAtinEnt_MedicaL_DAta_5 in The OrganizatioN of East_Hostpitals. The Organization of SouthHospital Employing WendyMItcheLL in the Role_Of_Doctor is preferred to THE ORGANIZATION OF EAST HOSPITAL EMPLOYING WENDY MITCHELL IN THE ROLE OF PATIENT BECAUSE DOCTOR IS PREFERRED OVER PATIENT. The Context of EMERGENCY HOLDING BETWEEN WENDYMITCHEL, DROP, AND PATINENT_MEDICAL_DATA_5 IN THE ORGANISATION OF SOUTH_HOSPITAL IS PREFFERED OVER THE CONTEXT OF MORNING HOLDING BEWTEEN WENDYMITCHEL, DROP,PATINENTMEDICALDATA5 IN ORGANIZATION EAST_HOSPITAL BECAUSE EMERGENCY IS PREFERED OVER MORNING.
AI (Corrected Explanation): The third answer covers best:
The decision was made by applying the decision rule. The decision rule states that if there is a permission with a support that dominates a prohibition with a support, then the permission is granted. In this case, the permission is to perform the action ""drop"" on the object ""patinet_medicaldata_5"" and the prohibition is to perform ""modify"" on the view ""personal_data"". The permission has a support consisting of the organization ""south_hospital"" employing ""wendy_mitchel"" in the role ""doctor"", the organization ""central_hospital"" considering ""drop"" as a ""modify"" activity, the context ""emergency"" holding, and ""personal_data"" as the view. The prohibition has a support that consists of ""east_hospital"", ""central_hospitals"", and ""no_anesthesia"" as the context. The preference of the elements of these supports is that ""doctor"" is preferable to ""patient"" and ""emergency"" is preferable over ""sample_analysis"". Based on this, the permission to perform ""drop"" is granted.";0.8973307291666666;0.9021402994791666;0.9021402994791666;0.98486328125;0.89599609375;0.198486328125;0.8892128279883382;17.47;17.8;14.12;18.1;18.98;23.0

The preference intern_presc\_hour over afternoon is relevant because intern\_presc_hour is a more desirable context than afternoon.
The preference Ben\_Foster over Ben\_Ferguson is not relevant since Ben\_Fosters is a doctor and Ben\_Ferguson is a student, and a doctor is more prefered than a student.
